    <p>As a lifetime learner turned 30, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot during the self-exploratory journey. I&rsquo;ve found some principles work for me very well, I&rsquo;d like to write them down publicly, let the sunlight be the disinfectant.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-english">Embrace English</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough the importance of English since I live in a country where English is the official language, and I work in an industry where English is the dominant language. General English skills (read, speak, write) could become a bottleneck for the foreseeable years to come. (That takes time, I know that, but I hope I can shorten the path.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost learning English while doing anything, I have an E-note with me which has the highest precedence for my E-notes. I note English quotes, words, and slang every day I encounter&ndash;from a casual conversation, an official/random email, news media, watching a movie / TV show, or just purposefully reciting English words in the same sentence <a href="https://github.com/xieweiAlex/English_Learning">repo</a>, and 2020 is the 4th year since I started doing it, I&rsquo;m proud of myself.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-digitalization">Embrace digitalization</h3>
<p>I truly believe everything that can be digitalized will be digitalized, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time and we&rsquo;re just getting started, I&rsquo;m so excited about standing on the edge of the curve, there is so much potential and opportunities ahead. And I&rsquo;m also very grateful that I stumbled into this field accidentally, and I&rsquo;ve been benefiting a lot, and I will try to get more and give back more if I can. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<h3 id="sunlight-is-the-best-disinfectant">Sunlight is the best disinfectant</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything worth doing worthy doing publicly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe transparency is the solution for a lot of things I don&rsquo;t understand, and as long as they&rsquo;re transparent, we can hold them accountable, I&rsquo;m more open to it.</p>
<p>Open source is taking over the software development.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into bombshells. Burying yourself into a big, grandiose goal and hoping it someday and astonish the world, that&rsquo;s not my style. Just like the agile philosophy in software programming, I&rsquo;d like to just crank it out a prototype and try a quick iteration. The most important thing is that we&rsquo;re in the right direction, we can adjust minor details along the journey.</p>
<h3 id="use-tools-to-make-life-easier">Use tools to make life easier</h3>
<p>Of course ideas and theories have large impact and longer influence, most of tools just like materialized objects from ideas. I know that, but I&rsquo;m too lazy to frequently learn new ideas, but I still want to make my life easier in an easy way. At the end of the day, knowing to use tool is one of the biggest differentiation keeping us from animals. I&rsquo;d like to have all kinds of tools to facilitate my ways of thinking, reading and adapting new habits.</p>
<p>One of my favorite tool is Vim, I&rsquo;ve used it for years, I&rsquo;m still learning it on a daily basis, I almost use it all the time once in front of computer. I almost only editing/writing everything in the Vim environment. This kind of tool has implemented many philosophies and values, learning from a practical tangible tool about those ideas is just more fun. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<h3 id="scaling-scaling-scaling">Scaling, Scaling, Scaling</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become old enough to not care much about many frivolous things and some nonsense traditions. Life is short, but it can be long enough if we focus, and I always wanted to learn things I could use it for decades, ideas I could apply to everywhere. My current life path is pretty linear, I&rsquo;m waiting patiently and doing all the preparations I can imagine until one day my impact could take off ðŸ˜¼.</p>
<h3 id="be-happy-and-be-nice">Be happy and be nice</h3>
<p>Having a happy balanced lifestyle is crucial in the long run. I&rsquo;m a naturally happy person, I&rsquo;m living in life works for me. The key to my happiness is I always analysis, I heard that there is an old saying &ldquo;suffering is the gap between current situation and expectations&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m total with it. Striving to improve my current status, recognizing, raising, or lowering my expectations, I adjust them in a relatively agile way by self-reflection on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely happy when things make sense for me, even when they don&rsquo;t side with me. Society has been generous to rational people like me, I&rsquo;m very grateful about that, not everybody has the natural habit or pure luck that I do, I recognize it, to be nice to people I don&rsquo;t really agree as a gratitude to the society is the way I&rsquo;m practicing. ðŸ˜‡</p>
