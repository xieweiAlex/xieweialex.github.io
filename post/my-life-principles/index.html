    <p>As a lifetime learner turned 30, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot during the self-exploratory journey. I&rsquo;ve found some principles work for me very well, I&rsquo;d like to write them down publicly, let the sunlight be the disinfectant.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-english">Embrace English</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough the importance of English since I live in a country where English is the official language, and I work in an industry where English is the dominant language. General English skills (read, speak, write) could become a bottleneck for the foreseeable years to come. (That takes time, I know that, but I hope I can shorten the path.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost learning English while doing anything, I have an E-note with me which has the highest precedence for my E-notes. I note English quotes, words, and slang every day I encounter&ndash;from a casual conversation, an official/random email, news media, watching a movie / TV show, or just purposefully reciting English words in the same sentence <a href="https://github.com/xieweiAlex/English_Learning">repo</a>, and 2020 is the 4th year since I started doing it, I&rsquo;m proud of myself.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-digitalization">Embrace digitalization</h3>
<p>I truly believe everything that can be digitalized will be digitalized, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time and we&rsquo;re just getting started, I&rsquo;m so excited about standing on the edge of the curve, there is so much potential and opportunities ahead. And I&rsquo;m also very grateful that I stumbled into this field accidentally, and I&rsquo;ve been benefiting a lot, and I will try to get more and give back more if I can. 😃</p>
<h3 id="sunlight-is-the-best-disinfectant">Sunlight is the best disinfectant</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything worth doing worthy doing publicly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe transparency is the solution for a lot of things I don&rsquo;t understand, and as long as they&rsquo;re transparent, we can hold them accountable, I&rsquo;m more open to it.</p>
<p>Open source is taking over the software development.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into bombshells. Burying yourself into a big, grandiose goal and hoping it someday and astonish the world, that&rsquo;s not my style. Just like the agile philosophy in software programming, I&rsquo;d like to just crank it out a prototype and try a quick iteration. The most important thing is that we&rsquo;re in the right direction, we can adjust minor details along the journey.</p>
<h3 id="use-tools-to-make-our-lives-better">Use tools to make our lives better</h3>
<p>Of course thinking and theory and more comprehensive and they have a bigger impact, tools just like materialized objects. I know that, but I&rsquo;m too lazy to frequently learn new ideas, but I still want to make my life easier in an easy way. At the end of the day, using tools is the biggest fact we differentiated with animals. I hope it would one of the ways to leverage my learning ability and changing velocity.</p>
<p>One of my favorite tools is Vim, I&rsquo;ve used it for years, I&rsquo;m still learning it on a daily basis, I&rsquo;m using it on a minute basis once I&rsquo;m on my laptop. I almost only editing/writing everything in the Vim environment. This kind of tool has implemented many philosophies and values, learning from a practical tangible tool about those ideas is just more fun. 😃</p>
<h3 id="scaling-scaling-scaling">Scaling, Scaling, Scaling</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become old enough to not care much about many frivolous things and some nonsense traditions. Life is short, but it can be long enough if we focus, and I always wanted to learn things I could use it for later decades, theories I could apply to everywhere. My current life path is linear, I&rsquo;m doing all the preparations I can imagine that one day my life takes off. 😼</p>
<h3 id="be-happy-and-be-nice">Be happy and be nice</h3>
<p>Having a happy balanced lifestyle is crucial in the long run. I&rsquo;m a naturally happy person, I&rsquo;m living in life works for me. The key to my happiness is I always analysis, I heard that there is an old saying &ldquo;suffering is the gap between current situation and expectations&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m total with it. Striving to improve my current status, recognizing, raising, or lowering my expectations, I adjust them in a relatively agile way by self-reflection on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely happy when things make sense for me, even when they don&rsquo;t side with me. Society has been generous to rational people like me, I&rsquo;m very grateful about that, not everybody has the natural habit or pure luck that I do, I recognize it, to be nice to people I don&rsquo;t really agree as a gratitude to the society is the way I&rsquo;m practicing. 😇</p>
