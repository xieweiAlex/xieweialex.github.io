<p>I often got asked about &ldquo;tell me about yourself&rdquo; and I got awkward and don&rsquo;t know where to start, so I am thinking why don&rsquo;t I just have a dedicated page to tell a bit about myself, so here it is. Of course I&rsquo;m biased, as my view conflicts with my own interest üòÉ.</p>
<h3 id="growth-mindset">Growth Mindset</h3>
<p>I stumbled on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU">this video</a> just a year ago, it has illustrated the idea of growth mindset and fixed mindset very well, and I immediately know <code>growth minset</code> is one of my most distinguishable characteristic.</p>
<p>I like to learn, and learn to learn, learn to change. I&rsquo;ve always had the most common topics for those people willing to change and learn. This is one part of reason I like science and IT industry, they keep evolving, they keep proving previous ways of doing things or theories wrong, and moving on new methodologies, I like it. Comparing with those things don&rsquo;t change or really hard to change, for example, traditions, religions, even marriage systems, education systems, etc, I&rsquo;ve never be a fan, I often found myself disparaging them relentlessly.</p>
<h3 id="stoicism">Stoicism</h3>
<p>The word &ldquo;stoic&rdquo; commonly refers to someone who is indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy.[8] The modern usage as a &ldquo;person who represses feelings or endures was first cited in 1579 as a noun and in 1596 as an adjective. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism</a>.</p>
<!-- As I grew up not in a very loving family environment(not saying my parents don't love me, they do), I've learned to be not depend on anyone in my very early life. -->    
<p>I&rsquo;m generally calm and happy most majority of time, though I do get emotional on rare cases, but it has been rarer and rarer, as I&rsquo;ve keeping learning myself and the world around me, I try to look at the world through radical rational lens, everything makes sense, if they don&rsquo;t, I will try to dig into it. So I usually don&rsquo;t get very happy or unhappy, no frustration or exciting, no drama, just keep making progress on things are important to me, onwards and upwards.</p>
<p>I rarely celebrate anything, I feel windfall happen to me not worth celebrating, and for those things I strove really hard for a long time, the results are already the best reward, I&rsquo;m gratified with them without additional activity.</p>
<h3 id="risk-taking">Risk taking</h3>
<p>ÊòéÊúùÈÇ£‰∫õ‰∫ã, Dwight Eisenhower</p>
<p>roller blades sliding, motorcycle</p>
<p>stock market, growth stocks</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>As I like tagging label, I know tag labels to others is not polite, but tagging myself I think it&rsquo;s fine. <em>This page is still WIP</em>.</p>
<p><strong>slow-poke</strong>
<strong>idealist</strong>
<strong>curiosity</strong>
<strong>enterprising</strong>
<strong>high self-esteem</strong>
<strong>emotional-stable</strong>
<strong>stoic</strong>
<strong>growth mindset</strong>
<strong>non-competitive</strong>
<strong>sapiosexual</strong></p>
<h3 id="animal-person">Animal Person</h3>
<p>I love animals without a doubt, I follow cute animal public accounts in any social media whatever I use, like Instagram, Twitter, FB or Wechat. I feel genuinely happy when I see cute animals, &ldquo;Thedodo&rdquo; is one of my favorite public account. I like both cats üê± and dogs üê∂. Though I feel cat is more cute in general(I spent more time on cat photos and videos), but I like dog the most, I admire and appreciate those natural traits from dogs, like loyalty, braveness and optimism. One of my ideal house would be having a small farm in backyard, I can grow some vegetables along with some animals.</p>
<h3 id="i-like-sports">I like Sports</h3>
<p>Looking back my grow up history, I liked a handful of sports. Doing exercise makes me excited and happy in general, and I always get friends while doing sport. I spent a big amount of teenage time playing basketball, I loved it. I played roller skating for years, then years of roller blading in college. I met my first girlfriend while playing roller skate in college. After college, I started like jogging regularly, most of time after sunset while listening podcast. Recently started late 2019, I started doing weight lifting(or muscle building), skateboarding and motorcycling (I consider riding motorcycle is a sport üò∫)</p>
<h3 id="ambivert">Ambivert</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an introvert person for sure, I can and willing to express my feeling and affection anytime needed. I talk a lot when with people or topic I&rsquo;m interested in, I believe communication is the key üîë for lots of problems. I like to exert my influence/endeavor to make things becoming better. But I don&rsquo;t have many friends social life, I&rsquo;m not a fan of gathering or party, social events drain my energy significantly. I rarely contact any of my friends which I know I should do more.</p>
<h3 id="open-minded">Open-minded</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m very open-minded and adaptive, I&rsquo;m a typical progressive liberal in America&rsquo;s political spectrum, I&rsquo;m open to a lots of novel ideas, I often got mind blown by those different ideas, and I enjoy exploring them. I&rsquo;m not a fan of lots of traditions no matter what culture it belongs or how long it has been adherent.</p>
<h3 id="optimist">Optimist</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a natural optimist, I tend to believe things are promising in our life, all the time. I tend to look for changes, make some changes, either physically or mentally, consciously or unconsciously, I believe changes bring to good, making progress with mistakes better than leaving regrets, etc.</p>
<h3 id="radical-rational">radical rational</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a rational personality. I like doing analysis and predictions. I believe our life progress bases on the decisions we make every day, whether big or small. I tend to analysis the world/society around me, I only believe things can be scientific tested. Those zodiac, religion are not my thing.</p>
<h3 id="adventurist">Adventurist</h3>
<p>I enjoy the feeling of risk-taking, it makes me being alive. I enjoy the adrenalin spike while riding motorcycle in open freeway(of course I wear protective gear every time). I enjoy any of those extreme sports, specially those sports require split-second decision making which spikes the adrenalin release. I do those sports to make myself both mentally and physically strong, and I feel happy when I&rsquo;m feeling strong ‚úä.</p>
