<p>I total understand as human nature nobody is 100% objective, everyone is biased instead. Specially things like culture, religion or belief etc, those topics are too big for us as nonprofessional to talk about. But as daily trial random things, well, some of them could also be bound with years of life experience.</p>
<p>But my point is we try to be as objective as we can, put our ego aside. I hate to discuss about anything with people who think their thoughts are absolutely right, anybody challenge their way of thinking is challenging themselves. Yeah, sounds weird, but lots of people do this way, even including myself sometimes. I think that&rsquo;s fine for something, like belief etc, those things are just so ingrained, they&rsquo;re so hard to pull out of ourselves, actually they&rsquo;ve become part of ourselves. I believe we should be proud, happy or at least accept those things ingrained to ourselves, they&rsquo;re part of ourselves. But lots of things are not, like people you like, political views you believe, they probably just gonna stay with you for days or years let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell sometimes, because everything I&rsquo;ve experienced, I believe, I like or hate made myself. But the rule of thumb is don&rsquo;t let ego become obstacle of your thinking. I like the idea from Ray Dalio, to stay &ldquo;radical open&rdquo;, everything I believe are absolutely right could be wrong in some case.</p>
<h3 id="easy-to-lose-their-temper">Easy to lose their temper</h3>
<p>I hate to discuss with people about something then all of sudden he lost his temper, I guess most of people feel the same. I always wonder why all of sudden those people lost their temper, I think either they&rsquo;re not used to be challenged or they become desperate when they can&rsquo;t convince the counterpart or they found they&rsquo;ve wasted too much time on the topics don&rsquo;t matter, these are the scenarios I could image or understand, there are could tons of reasons various by person which I don&rsquo;t understand. Sometimes I also lost my temper because people behavior total out of my expectation, so I need to learn to get myself mentally prepared.</p>
<p>At the end of day, I&rsquo;m also a human, even though I&rsquo;m super rational, I could be ruffled by confusing or surprising sometimes. I try not to, I try to understand people, as long as I understand those behavior, I got my mentally prepared, I don&rsquo;t have to forcefully sell my ideas, I won&rsquo;t get myself in desperate, I should be fine. At the end of day, I&rsquo;m not suppose to change anybody&rsquo;s idea, talk or interact with others all just for myself improving and having fun, I want to be relax and enjoy along the way.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t change people&rsquo;s way of doing things, and some people&rsquo;s radical behavior could obviously affect my mood, in one party, I should try to learn and understand those people or behavior, in other hand, I should learn to let it go, there are so many things or people in the world I could never understand, I&rsquo;m not a god, just let it go and leave my normal happy life.</p>
