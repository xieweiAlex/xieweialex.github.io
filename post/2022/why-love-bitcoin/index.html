<p>I&rsquo;m a veteran of Bitcoin, I first bought into the idea in 2013, at the time I had never bought any stocks or other financial assets, but I liked the idea of desentialized money and of course the hypes. Of course as always, right after I got in, the market started crashing, I was quite disapointed, I let it go and sold all of my holdings in 2016 right before I came to the US.</p>
<p>The 2nd time I got back in was in Dec 2019, I remember I had a talk with my colleagues Jeremy in a happy hour, I brought it up that China banned Bitcoin again blablabla, I don&rsquo;t remember</p>
