<p>Hello fellow Toastmasters, today we&rsquo;re gonna talk about &ldquo;Communication styles.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know there is a thing called &ldquo;communication styles&rdquo; until I started preparing this speech and took the quiz, they are 4 styles in total, they are &ldquo;supportive&rdquo;, &ldquo;direct&rdquo;, &ldquo;initiative&rdquo;, &ldquo;analytical&rdquo;. After took the quiz, I got to know my two dominant styles are supportive and direct. I loved it, I do think it makes sense as much as I know myself. Some people might be wondering, isn&rsquo;t these two contradicting with each other? Well, let me explain.</p>
<h3 id="supportive-style">Supportive Style</h3>
<!-- The supportive style is calm, steady, approachable, and often perceived as careful, patient and amiable. --> 
<!-- Another example could be our most popular outdoor activity, hiking. I naturally don't have a good sense of direction, so I incline to rely on others whenever I'm with other people, I don't pretend to know anything, I don't feel ashamed as well, just to be a good supporting follower. I follow anybody who leads, whether I know them or not, they probably have better sense of direction than me ðŸ˜„. --> 
<p>First, the supportive style, there is an example: few weeks ago a sunny Wednesday after work, I went to indoor rock climbing with my roommate Eric, it was fun and we had a good time there, we met a friend Jason he proposed that we go out for a quick bite after this intense workout.</p>
<p>That sounds like a great idea, but I was and still now practicing 16:8 intermittent fasting, which I&rsquo;m not supposed to eat after 8 pm, at that moment it was already 8 pm. I hesitated for a second, and I told myself that rules are supposed to be broken on occasion, it should not be a big deal. So I responded &ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there comes next question, &ldquo;what kind of food should we go?&rdquo; I said I like Ramen, or there is a Chipotle closeby as well. But they were like &ldquo;Nah.&rdquo; Jason proposed &ldquo;How about chick-fil-A? It&rsquo;s just across the street.&rdquo; Eric was pretty much onboard with that. But it really puts me off, the last thing I want is deep fried fast food. But within seconds, I talked over myself: &ldquo;we just had an intense workout, it should&rsquo;ve killed tons of calorie, it should be alright.&rdquo; Then we went there and it was delicious.</p>
<p>In a hindsight, it not uncommon for me to &ldquo;wrest my arms&rdquo; in order to fit in, not only communication but interaction with people in general.</p>
<h2 id="direct-style">Direct style</h2>
<p>Well, there is another side of me, the &ldquo;Direct&rdquo; me, I sometimes being called blunt for that. For example, last time in a party one of my friend Bishal approached me and asked a question, which he has asked me many times, &ldquo;is this a good time to buy Bitcoin?&rdquo; I replied without thinking for a second &ldquo;Yes, this is a good time, nobody can really time the market, so any time is a good time. And don&rsquo;t ask me the same question.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Okay&rdquo; and then walked away, I knew he probably doesn&rsquo;t like the answer, and he might be offended a bit. And I&rsquo;m Okay with it.</p>
<p>Yes, I literally told him &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me the same question&rdquo; in front of his face, some people might frown upon this kind of &ldquo;rudeness&rdquo;. Of course I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt him in any regard, and I&rsquo;m also not a financial pro as well, I was just expressing what&rsquo;s really in my mind.</p>
<p>I know many people have problem saying NO in front of others, I&rsquo;m the same when I&rsquo;m being the &ldquo;supportive style&rdquo;. But when topics fall into what I have confidence in or I&rsquo;m passionate about, I become a &ldquo;Direct&rdquo; me. Topics like crypto, stock market, programming, productive tools/hacks etc.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-end">In the end</h3>
<p>Here you have it, fellow Toastmasters, that&rsquo;s my two dominant communication styles, supportive and direct. How do you like it, what&rsquo;s your communication style, let me know and we can discuss about it offline.</p>
