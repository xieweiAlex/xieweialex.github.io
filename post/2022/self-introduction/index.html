<p>I often got asked about &ldquo;tell me about yourself&rdquo; and I got awkward and I don&rsquo;t know where to start, so I am thinking why don&rsquo;t I just have a dedicated place to dig through my soul, what differentiate myself with others, so here it is. Of course I&rsquo;m biased, as my view conflicts with my own interest 😃.</p>
<p>There are could be primarily 3 traits I cherish them as my identity. Growth mindset, stoic and risk taking, ofc there are a lots of miscellaneous items I can list them in the end.</p>
<h3 id="growth-mindset">Growth Mindset</h3>
<p>I stumbled on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU">this video</a> just a year ago, it illustrated the idea of growth mindset vs fixed mindset pretty well, and I immediately knew that&rsquo;s it, <code>growth minset</code> is one of my most distinguishable characteristic, and I just didn&rsquo;t know the term.</p>
<p>I like to learn, and I like to learn how to learn, I like to change and be adaptive. I&rsquo;ve always have the most common topics with people craving to learn &amp; change, I hate feeling stuck in the mud.</p>
<p>This is one fundamental reason I like science and IT industry in general, they just keep evolving, relentlessly. I often heard/saw people complaining in IT industry new grad can get compensated as good as people worked for 10 years, that&rsquo;s because experience often isn&rsquo;t that much valuable as other industry in IT, everything evolving way faster here. Comparing with those things don&rsquo;t really change much for decades or even longer, such as traditions/ritual, religions, marriage system, education system etc, they are what they were decades ago, I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of them. And I often found myself disparaging them relentlessly.</p>

<h3 id="stoicism">Stoicism</h3>
<p>The word &ldquo;stoic&rdquo; commonly refers to someone who is indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy.[8] The modern usage as a &ldquo;person who represses feelings or endures was first cited in 1579 as a noun and in 1596 as an adjective. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism</a>.</p>
<!-- As I grew up not in a very loving family environment(not saying my parents don't love me, they do), I've learned to be not depend on anyone in my very early life. -->    
<p>I&rsquo;m generally calm and happy most majority of time, though I do get emotional on rare cases, but it has been rarer and rarer, as I&rsquo;ve keeping learning myself and the world around me, I try to look at the world through radical rational lens, everything makes sense, if they don&rsquo;t, I will try to dig into it. So I usually don&rsquo;t get very happy or unhappy, no frustration or exciting, no drama, just keep making progress on things are important to me, onwards and upwards.</p>
<p>I rarely celebrate anything, I feel windfall happen to me not worth celebrating, and for those things I strove really hard for a long time, the results are already the best reward, I&rsquo;m gratified with them without additional activity.</p>
<p>build resistance</p>
<h3 id="risk-taking">Risk taking</h3>
<p>People around me but don&rsquo;t know me well would be surprised to know that I&rsquo;m a risk taker. My daily behavior is quite deceptive, as I&rsquo;m quite easygoing and carefree. But deep bottom of my heart, I&rsquo;m actually quite enterprising and ambitious. I like to take challenges people don&rsquo;t even dare to think of, it makes feel good.</p>
<p>Looking back my grew up history, I&rsquo;ve always liked sports, and I played many of them, such as biking, basketball, roller skating/blading, swimming, snowboarding(none of them I played well enough to stand out). The one stick with me the longest is roller skating/blading, I like those dangerous tricks the most, those freestyle stunts, those which either you make it or you go to hospital for it(luckily I never fall bad enough to go to hospital).</p>
<p>My favorite part of those stunts is they require split-second decision, I like the extremely focused status, the adrenalin spikes, the courage and determination, and I often inspired by those videos as well(I guess most of us do). I don&rsquo;t mind get hurt in some extent, it&rsquo;s par for the course, and it only makes me stronger and tougher.</p>
<p>I feel lots similarities while riding motorcycle in freeway, unlike driving in the car, riding motorcycle is quite dangerous and intense, but it&rsquo;s so much fun because of them.</p>
<!-- I found my role model through reading the series book "明朝那些事" in college, and re-read it the 1st year out of school. This book is huge, it illustrated 100s of people's life through Ming dynasty's 300 years history. And there is one person's story really pound my heart hard, I already forgot his name, he is famous for fighting in battle ground in the front-tier, he is so good at fighting, and he is so gravitated to fight. There were numerous times he got himself trapped, and he fought it through, he mentioned "It's a shame for a fighter to die at home on a death bed". A few years later, I read the autobiography of Dwight Eisenhower, he was almost exactly the same, they're my role model, through we live in a relative peace time and war is evil, but I'd like to fight like them in business world as an entrepreneur. -->   
<!-- I enjoy the feeling of risk-taking, it makes me being alive. I enjoy the adrenalin spike while riding motorcycle in open freeway(of course I wear protective gear every time). I enjoy any of those extreme sports, specially those sports require split-second decision making which spikes the adrenalin release. I do those sports to make myself both mentally and physically strong, and I feel happy when I'm feeling strong ✊. -->   
<!-- Looking back my grow up history, I liked a handful of sports. Doing exercise makes me excited and happy in general, and I always get friends while doing sport. I spent a big amount of teenage time playing basketball, I loved it. I played roller skating for years, then years of roller blading in college. I met my first girlfriend while playing roller skate in college. After college, I started like jogging regularly, most of time after sunset while listening podcast. Recently started late 2019, I started doing weight lifting(or muscle building), skateboarding and motorcycling (I consider riding motorcycle is a sport 😺) -->

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<p><strong>slow-poke</strong>
<strong>idealist</strong>
<strong>emotional stable</strong>
<strong>sapiosexual</strong></p>
<h4 id="animal-person">Animal Person</h4>
<p>I love animals without a doubt, I follow cute animal public accounts in all social media platforms I use. I feel genuinely happy when I see cute animals, &ldquo;Thedodo&rdquo; is my favorite public account. I like both 🐱 and 🐶. Though I feel cat is cuter in internet(I spent more time on cat photos and videos), but I like dogs the most. I admire and appreciate those natural traits of dogs, such as loyalty, braveness and optimism, communication etc. One of my ideal house would be having a small farm in the backyard, I can plant some vegetables and raise some small cute animals.</p>
<h4 id="ambivert">Ambivert</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an introvert person, I do like social in some extent, and good vibes and laughs. I talk a lot when people or topic I&rsquo;m familiar with or interested in, I prefer over communicate instead of under communicate.</p>
<p>I like to exert my influence/endeavor to make things becoming better. But I don&rsquo;t have many friends social life, I&rsquo;m not a fan of gathering or party, social events drain my energy significantly. I rarely contact any of my friends which I know I should do more.</p>
<h4 id="open-minded">Open-minded</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m very open-minded and adaptive, I&rsquo;m a typical progressive liberal in America&rsquo;s political spectrum, I&rsquo;m open to a lots of novel ideas, I often got mind blown by those different ideas, and I enjoy exploring them. I&rsquo;m not a fan of lots of traditions no matter what culture it belongs or how long it has been adherent.</p>
<h4 id="optimist">Optimist</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m a natural optimist, I tend to believe things are promising in life or society. I tend to look for changes, or make changes, either physically or mentally, consciously or unconsciously. I believe changes bring good, I&rsquo;d rather make changes with mistakes than stay put with regrets.</p>
<h4 id="radical-rational">radical rational</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite rational, I like to do analyze and solve problem. I believe on making good decisions every day would is the essence of progress, whether they&rsquo;re big or small. I tend to reasoning the world/society around me, I only believe things can be scientific proved. For example, horoscope and religion are not my thing.</p>
