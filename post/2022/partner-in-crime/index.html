<h1 id="how-it-started">How it started</h1>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve grown older (30+), I&rsquo;ve found myself spending more and more time alone. While I value my independence, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a longing for a partner in crime to share my life with. The feeling of loneliness has started to creep in, and I&rsquo;m ready to find someone to join me on this journey.</p>
<p>So I asked around in my friend circle, I often get asked the question, &ldquo;what kind of partners are you searching for?&rdquo; It frustrates me when I can&rsquo;t articulate my thoughts. So I figured I could write them down, since there is nothing secretive about it.</p>
<p>Basically I&rsquo;m looking for a girl who shares some similarities with me, particularly in terms of values and lifestyle, I believe that&rsquo;s what makes a relationship successful.</p>
<h1 id="values-i-look-for">Values I look for</h1>
<h3 id="positive-vibes">Positive Vibes</h3>
<p>I am naturally an optimistic person and I value this trait. I have worked hard to cultivate it.</p>
<p>I find it challenging to work or live with negative or pessimistic people. While I understand that they may have valid concerns, constant complaining without offering solutions or taking action can be draining. I do my fair share of venting, but I am actively trying to improve and be more positive.</p>
<h3 id="receptive--open-minded--learn-and-change">Receptive / Open-minded / learn and change</h3>
<p>I came from a country on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. While I have a deep appreciation for American and Western culture, I cannot deny that my Asian heritage holds a special place in my heart. Ideally, I would love to find someone who shares a similar background or is at least interested in Asian culture.</p>
<p>PS. I would like to write an article discussing the differences between Asian culture and American culture.</p>
<p>I have a curious and open-minded nature, always eager to expand my knowledge and skills through learning new tools, tips, and theories. I am particularly interested in topics related to productivity and self-improvement, constantly seeking ways to enhance my personal growth.
It is not a requirement for my partner to support my pursuits, but it would be beautiful if we share a similar mindset and can support each other&rsquo;s growth and learning.</p>
<p>In the year 2022, I have embarked on a journey of exploration. I have delved into various interests, which I plan to continue for the foreseeable future. These include fermentation, such as making sauerkraut, kombucha, kimchi, and yogurt etc. As well as studying MBTI and Carl Jung&rsquo;s personality theories, and delving into the ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism. I have dedicated over 100 hours to each of these pursuits, and I find myself constantly eager to discuss them with others.</p>
<p>I find joy in applying what I&rsquo;ve learned to my daily life. However, I often encounter conflicts with traditional practices. I struggle to understand why people continue to adhere to traditions when they know they are wrong or there is a better alternative. I understand that change can be difficult though.</p>
<p>For instance, I have always eaten white rice, but I have recently cut it out of my diet in an effort to reduce carbs intake (except when eating out with others). I also do not eat breakfast, as I follow a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule (contrary to the belief that breakfast is the most important meal of the day). These are just a few examples of how I incorporate my learning into my daily routine.</p>
<h3 id="supportive--empathetic--feminine">Supportive / Empathetic / Feminine</h3>
<p>Despite not being a Feeler(In MBTI&rsquo;s parlance), I believe my upbringing has made me less attuned to emotions. However, I highly value people who are supportive, considerate, and empathetic. Intelligence, ambition, and even strength are not necessary for me, as I am happy to take on the traditional masculine role of responsibility.</p>
<p>I do not consider myself a macho person though, I see myself as a mild feminist.</p>
<h1 id="lifestyles-i-look-for">Lifestyles I look for</h1>
<h3 id="intuition">Intuition</h3>
<p>In MBTI&rsquo;s parlance again: I am an &ldquo;Ni&rdquo; (Introverted Intuitive) person, meaning I am naturally drawn to abstract concepts rather than tangible objects.</p>
<p>For example, my typical table topics often center around topics like macro/micro economy, technology, business, personal growth, and psychology. I tend to overlook discussions about material possessions/obsession or sensory experiences, such as fine dining, sightseeing, beauty, partying etc.</p>
<p>Bringing this up not to put it as a requirement but to seek understanding, I know lots of people are not like me, and I understand. I hope my partner understands my interest as well.</p>
<h3 id="emotional-stability">Emotional Stability</h3>
<p>I am happy to say that I am emotionally stable and I place a high value on it. It is disheartening to see people who struggle with their emotions.</p>
<p>I find solace in learning Stoicism, an ancient Greek philosophy. As Nasim Taleb eloquently stated, Stoicism is “the domestication of emotions, not their elimination.”</p>
<p>Maintaining a consistent light mood critically important for me. I understand that it may not be easy for everyone, myself included, to achieve this consistently. Let&rsquo;s work together to improve on this aspect.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>I have always been known for my frugal lifestyle, often joking that my spending habits are more in line with a recent college graduate. But for me, it&rsquo;s a conscious and responsible choice. I have little interest in material possessions and instead prioritize saving money. As long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect my health or take up too much of my time, I see it as a virtue.</p>
<p>I may not be fond of individuals who constantly seek out a lavish lifestyle. While I understand the occasional desire to indulge in worldly pleasures, I believe it should be done consciously and in moderation.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in the power of investing and currently have a significant portion of my portfolio allocated to high-risk assets such as stocks and cryptos(Bitcoin). However, as I continue to grow and diversify my investments, I plan to gradually shift towards more stable assets like Real Estate and bonds. It&rsquo;s important to me that my partner shares a similar mindset and is not too much afraid to take calculated risks.</p>
<h3 id="active-physically-and-mentally">Active (Physically and mentally)</h3>
<p>I am passionate about staying active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle through various sports and physical exercises. I am looking for a partner who also values physical activity and would be open to joining me in activities such as hiking, jogging, swimming, kayaking etc, and more during our free time.</p>
<p>I like to learn new things(theories, tools, ideas or even recipes for food), I&rsquo;d love to share those things to my partner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also passionate about learning and expanding my knowledge, whether it be through exploring new theories, tools, or new recipes. I find great joy in sharing my discoveries with my partner and am always excited to see their reaction.</p>
<h2 id="physical-appearance">Physical appearance</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a saint, and just like any other guy, I&rsquo;m attracted to good-looking girls. However, I understand that those superficial traits don&rsquo;t matter much in a relationship. What truly matters is compatibility in terms of personality, values, and lifestyle, which are the foundations for a lasting connection.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end</h2>
<p>There you have it! These are the things I can think of for a successful relationship for me. Of course, the list is not exhaustive, but we can start from here.</p>
