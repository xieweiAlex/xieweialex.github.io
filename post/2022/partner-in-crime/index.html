<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been alone for a while, and I&rsquo;m getting old(30+), I started feeling the urge to have a &ldquo;partner in crime&rdquo;, AKA, feeling lonely.
So I asked around, and people always ask me back &ldquo;what kind of girl are you looking for? &quot; I hate not being able to articulate what&rsquo;s in my mind, so I decided to write it down since there is nothing secretive about it.</p>
<p>Basically, I&rsquo;m looking for a girl who is just like me, I know it sounds quite narcissistic, but that&rsquo;s my genuine feeling.
Maybe because I&rsquo;m quite self-contained and happy overall, I don&rsquo;t want to break my inner peace, and I&rsquo;ve seen some couples holding quite different values/lifestyles, and staying together just to get by, and unhappy, I hope not to be like that.</p>
<p>Of course, people are different, something that is easy for me might be difficult for another person. I can take compromises, this post is just a brain dump, and it can be taken as a reference.</p>
<h2 id="values-i-look-for">Values I look for</h2>
<h3 id="positiveoptimistic">Positive/optimistic</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimistic and happy person in general, and I value it.
I live by hope, as opposed to fear, stress, or other stuff. I&rsquo;m happy to see progress or improvement, that&rsquo;s the primary drive for my day-to-day life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to work/live with negative people, or people who are over-pessimistic, even though I know sometimes their points are valid, but if there is no hope or action taking place, I would not enjoy whining about them.</p>
<h3 id="receptive--open-minded">Receptive / Open-minded</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m from China, and as much as I love American/Western culture, I can&rsquo;t deny that deep down I&rsquo;m still Chinese. I think ideally she is an Asian descendant or at least into Asian culture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite open-minded, and I enjoy learning new things(tools/ideas/concepts), and anything related to productivity and self-improvement.
Not necessarily my partner needs to like/agree with whatever I&rsquo;m pursuing, but I hope to see she has a similar mindset, ideally we can learn and grow together.</p>
<p>For example, in this year 2022, I&rsquo;ve embarked on quite some explorations.
Fermentation (Sauerkraut, Kombucha, kamichi, yogurt, etc),  MBTI, and stoicism, just to name a few I&rsquo;ve probably invested 100+ hours in each of them, and I&rsquo;d love to talk about them anytime.</p>
<h3 id="supportive-feminine">Supportive, feminine</h3>
<p>My ideal partner would be compassionate, loving, considerate, etc, just some typical feminine traits I guess.<br>
I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;male chauvinistic&rdquo; person per se, on the contrary, I see myself as a mild feminist. I like independent souls, but strong-minded/feisty females are not my ideal choice.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyles-i-look-for">Lifestyles I look for</h2>
<h3 id="abstraction-vs-sensing">Abstraction vs Sensing</h3>
<p>In MBTI&rsquo;s parlance, I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;Ni&rdquo; (Introverted Intuitive) person, I&rsquo;m drawn into abstraction, as opposed to tangible materials/experience.</p>
<p>For example, my typical table topics are related to economy, business, power, psychology, tools(software, ideas, gadgets), etc. And I often found myself despising those material, superficial, sensual stuff/experiences. For instance: fine dining, clothing, &ldquo;excessive cleaning&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>Bringing this up not to put it as a requirement but to seek understanding, I know lots of people are not like me, and I can surely understand.
I hope my partner understands it as well.</p>
<h3 id="emotion">Emotion</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite emotionally stable, and I value it. I&rsquo;ve seen many people who are not, and not even working on it, nor see it as a problem, that&rsquo;s a big no-no to me.</p>
<p>I believe in stoicism(an ancient philosophy), the overarching idea of stoicism is accepting what you can&rsquo;t control and having the courage to change what you can and having the wisdom to tell the difference.</p>
<p>Maintaining a consistent light mood is essential for me, I don&rsquo;t expect everyone, myself included, could achieve that easily, we could work on that at least.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>I live quite modestly overall, I often joke that my spending capability is like a new grad, and I&rsquo;m proud of it.
I came from a humble beginning, I have always lived below my means, I guess it is probably applicable to most immigrants.</p>
<p>So I probably won&rsquo;t be happy with people who enjoy extravagant (money-wise) lifestyles. I don&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t indulge ourselves with some worldly pressure, we certainly can, but just do it sparingly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in investing, currently, I&rsquo;m mostly invested in risky assets (stock and crypto), and I&rsquo;d gradually move some of them to Real Estate and other safer assets. I hope my partner would not be a risk-averse person.</p>
<h3 id="active">Active</h3>
<p>I like all kinds of sports and workouts, I value maintaining a fit body, that&rsquo;s the foundation of health. I hope my partner would enjoy physical activity as well, and we can do something like hiking, jogging, swimming, or kayaking in our spare time.</p>
<h2 id="physical-appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a saint, and I do like hot ladies. As for physical appearance, I value overall body shape and energy way more than the face.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end</h2>
<p>There you have it, just primarily &ldquo;Values&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifestyles&rdquo;, of course, there are lots of other things I care about, we can go from here.</p>
