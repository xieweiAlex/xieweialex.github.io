<h1 id="how-it-started">How it started</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been alone for a while, and I&rsquo;m getting old(30+), I started feeling the urge to have a &ldquo;partner in crime&rdquo;, AKA, feeling lonely.
So I asked around, and people have always asked back &ldquo;what kind of partner are you looking for? &quot; I hate not being able to articulate what&rsquo;s in my mind, so I figured I could write it down, since there is nothing secretive about it.</p>
<p>Basically I&rsquo;m looking for a girl who is just like me in a lot of ways, ideally of course, having similar values and lifestyles, I believe that&rsquo;s what makes a relationship successful.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m aware in real life lots of rules / preferences would be overshadowed when there is chemistry happening, but we can still take it as a grain of salt.</p>
<h1 id="values-i-look-for">Values I look for</h1>
<h3 id="positive-vibes">Positive vibes</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimistic person by nature, and I value it, I worked hard on it.
I live by hope, as it opposes to fear or worry. I strive to be better day by day, and I&rsquo;m pretty happy to see what I&rsquo;ve gone through over the years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to work/live too closely with negative or pessimistic people, Even though I know their probably have valid points, but if there are no actionable items or alternative, some whinings could only be useful in certain limit.</p>
<h3 id="receptive--open-minded">Receptive / Open-minded</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m from China, and as much as I love American/Western culture, I can&rsquo;t deny that deep down I still hold a lot of value from Asian roots. I think ideally she is an Asian descendant or at least into Asian culture. (ps. I need to write another an article about what I see the difference between Asian culture vs American culture.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite open-minded, and I like to learn new things(tools/tips/theories), and anything related to productivity and self-improvement.
Not necessarily my partner needs to onboard with whatever I pursue, but it would be great if she has similar mindset, we can learn and grow together.</p>
<p>For example, in the year 2022, I&rsquo;ve embarked on quite some explorations. I see myself would stick with them for quite some time.<br>
Fermentation (Sauerkraut, Kombucha, kimchi, yogurt, etc),  MBTI (personality test), and stoicism (ancient Greek philosophy), just to name a few. I&rsquo;ve probably invested 100+ hours in each of them, and I can&rsquo;t stop myself from talking about them.</p>
<p>I like to apply to what I&rsquo;ve learned to daily life, it truly make me happy. But those practice often conflicts with traditions, I don&rsquo;t always understand why people stick with traditions when they know it&rsquo;s wrong or there is a better way. Though I know changing is hard.</p>
<p>For example, I had been eating white rice my whole life, and I&rsquo;ve let it out of my diet because I&rsquo;d like to cut off carbs.(besides eating out with others). I don&rsquo;t eat breakfast (I do 16:8 intermittent fasting, <strong>breakfast is not the most important meal of the day</strong>), just to new a few.</p>
<h3 id="supportive--empathetic--feminine">Supportive / Empathetic / Feminine</h3>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m not a Feeler person, (I ascribe this to my relative rough upbringing), but I always appreciate people being supportive/considerate/empathetic, she doesn&rsquo;t need to be very smart, ambitious or even strong, I&rsquo;d like to take the more traditional masculine part of responsibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a macho person in any sense, on the contrary, I see myself as a mild feminist.</p>
<h1 id="lifestyles-i-look-for">Lifestyles I look for</h1>
<h3 id="intuition-vs-sensing">Intuition vs Sensing</h3>
<p>This is MBTI&rsquo;s parlance, I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;Ni&rdquo; (Introverted Intuitive) person, I&rsquo;m drawn into abstract things, as opposed to tangible items.</p>
<p>For example, my typical table topics are more often related to economy, business, habit(personal growth), psychology, productivity tools etc. And I often found myself shrugging off at those material, sensual things or experiences- things like fine dining, clothing, partying, even excessive cleaning.</p>
<p>Bringing this up not to put it as a requirement but to seek understanding, I know lots of people are not like me, and I surely understand. I hope my partner understands my interest as well.</p>
<h3 id="emotion-stability">Emotion Stability</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite emotionally stable, and I value it. I see so many people who are not, and they&rsquo;re not even working on it, nor see it as a problem, that&rsquo;s a big no-no to me.</p>
<p>I believe in Stoicism(an ancient Greek philosophy), as Nasim Taleb put it perfectly, Stoicism is about “the domestication of emotions, not their elimination.”</p>
<p>Maintaining a consistent light mood is essential for me, I don&rsquo;t expect everyone, myself included, could achieve that easily, we could work on that at least.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>I live a quite frugal life comparing with most people around me, I often joke about that my spending ability is like a new grad. I think it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, I have low desire for material stuff. I always try to safe money, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t hurt my health and take too much time, I see it as a virtue.</p>
<p>So I probably won&rsquo;t be happy with people who enjoy extravagant lifestyle. I don&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t indulge ourselves with some worldly pressure some times, but just do it consciously and less frequently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in investing, and currently I&rsquo;m mostly invested in risky assets(stocks and crypto), and I would gradually lean to safer assets like Real Estate and bonds. I hope my partner would not be a risk-averse person, because I enjoy take calculated risks.</p>
<h3 id="activephysically-and-mentally">Active(Physically and mentally)</h3>
<p>I like all kinds of sports and physical exercises, I work hard to maintain a fit body. I hope my partner would enjoy physical activity to some extend, and we can do some group exercises like hiking, jogging, swimming, or kayaking etc in spare time.</p>
<p>I like to learn new things(theories, tools, ideas or even recipes for food), I&rsquo;d love to share those things to my partner.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-end">At the end</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a saint, I&rsquo;m naturally attracted to good-looking girls like any other dude. But I always know those traits would only get us started, and personality, value and lifestyles alignment would keep us going for a long term.</p>
<p>There are could be lost of things I miss from my logical mind, I would be very grateful if you let me know about them.</p>
