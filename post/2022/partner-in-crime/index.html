<h1 id="how-it-started">How it started</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been alone for a while, and I&rsquo;m getting old(30+), I started feeling the urge to have a &ldquo;partner in crime&rdquo;, AKA, feeling lonely.
So I asked around, and people have always ask back &ldquo;what kind of girl/partner are you looking for? &quot; I hate not being able to articulate what I&rsquo;m looking, so I decided to write it down, since there is nothing secretive about.</p>
<p>Basically, I&rsquo;m looking for a girl who is just like me, having similar values and lifestyles, I believe that&rsquo;s what makes a relationship successful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy person overall, I don&rsquo;t want to break my inner peace. I&rsquo;ve seen some couples holding quite different values/lifestyles, they often fight on things which is predicable, I don&rsquo;t want to be like that. But who knows, every couples have their own problems to solve, I might end with exactly I what I want to avoid, lol, I hope not.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m aware in real life lots of rules / preference / logic don&rsquo;t apply when chemistry happen, so we can take it as a grain of salt.</p>
<h1 id="values-i-look-for">Values I look for</h1>
<h3 id="positive--optimistic-vibes">Positive / Optimistic vibes</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimistic and happy person in general, and I value it.
I live by hope, as opposed to fear, anxiety, or other negative stuff. I strive to be better day to day, and I&rsquo;m happy to see progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to work/live with negative people, or people who are over-pessimistic. Even though I know sometimes their points are valid, but if there is no hope or action could be taken place, I would not enjoy whining about them.</p>
<h3 id="receptive--open-minded">Receptive / Open-minded</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m from China, and as much as I love American/Western culture, I can&rsquo;t deny that deep down I still hold a lot of value from Asian culture in general. I think ideally she is an Asian descendant or quite into Asian culture. (ps. I need to write another an article about what I see the difference Asian culture vs American culture. )</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite open-minded, and I like to learning new things(tools/ideas/concepts), and anything related to productivity and self-improvement.
Not necessarily my partner needs to like/agree with whatever I&rsquo;m pursuing, but it would be great if she has similar mindset, we can learn and grow together.</p>
<p>For example, in this year 2022, I&rsquo;ve embarked on quite some explorations. I see myself would stick with them for quite some time.<br>
Fermentation (Sauerkraut, Kombucha, kimchi, yogurt, etc),  MBTI (personality test), and stoicism (ancient philosophy), just to name a few. I&rsquo;ve probably invested 100+ hours in each of them, and I love to talk about them anytime.</p>
<p>I like to learn new things and apply to my day to day life, it makes me happy. When they conflict with traditions, often I&rsquo;d ditch the traditions, so ideally my partner is not very traditional.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve been eating white rice my whole life, and I&rsquo;ve ditched it without issue (besides dinning out). I don&rsquo;t eat breakfast (I do 16:8 intermittent fasting,  breakfast is not the most important meal of the day), just to new a few.</p>
<h3 id="supportive-feminine">Supportive, feminine</h3>
<p>My ideal partner would be compassionate, loving, considerate, etc, just some typical feminine traits I guess.<br>
I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;male chauvinistic&rdquo; person in any sense, on the contrary, I see myself as a mild feminist. I like independent souls, but strong-minded/feisty females are not my ideal choice.</p>
<h1 id="lifestyles-i-look-for">Lifestyles I look for</h1>
<h3 id="abstraction-vs-sensing">Abstraction vs Sensing</h3>
<p>In MBTI&rsquo;s parlance, I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;Ni&rdquo; (Introverted Intuitive) person, I&rsquo;m drawn into abstraction, as opposed to tangible materials/experience.</p>
<p>For example, my typical table topics are mostly related to economy, business, habit, psychology, learning, tools(software, ideas, gadgets) etc. And I often found myself despising those material, superficial, sensual stuff/experiences. For instance: fine dining, clothing, partying, &ldquo;excessive cleaning&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>Bringing this up not to put it as a requirement but to seek understanding, I know lots of people are not like me, and I can surely understand. I hope my partner understands my interest as well.</p>
<h3 id="emotion">Emotion</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite emotionally stable, and I value it. I&rsquo;ve seen many people who are not, and not even working on it, nor see it as a problem, that&rsquo;s a big no-no to me.</p>
<p>I believe in stoicism(an ancient Greek philosophy), the overarching idea of stoicism is accepting what you can&rsquo;t control, and having the courage to change what you can, and the wisdom to tell the difference.</p>
<p>Maintaining a consistent light mood is essential for me, I don&rsquo;t expect everyone, myself included, could achieve that easily, we could work on that at least.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>I live quite frugal comparing with most people around me, I often joke about that my spending capability is like a new grad. And I&rsquo;m actually proud of it.</p>
<p>I had a humble beginning growing up, I have always lived below my means, I guess it is probably applicable to most immigrants.</p>
<p>So I probably won&rsquo;t be happy with people who enjoy extravagant(money-wise) lifestyle. I don&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t indulge ourselves with some worldly pressure, we certainly can, but just do it sparingly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in investing, currently, I&rsquo;m mostly invested in risky assets (stock and crypto), and I&rsquo;d gradually move some of them to Real Estate and other safer assets. I hope my partner would not be a risk-averse person.</p>
<h3 id="active">Active</h3>
<p>I like all kinds of sports and workouts, I value maintaining a fit body as a foundation of health. I hope my partner would enjoy physical activity as well, and we can do something like hiking, jogging, swimming, or kayaking in our spare time.</p>
<p>I like to workout, I like to be energetic etc, I hope you have some similarities.</p>
<h2 id="physical-appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a saint, I do like attractive girls of course. But I care about body shape and overall energy way more than pretty face.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-end">In the end</h1>
<p>Here you have it, primarily just &ldquo;Values&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifestyles&rdquo;. Of course, there are some other things I care about, we can go from here.</p>
