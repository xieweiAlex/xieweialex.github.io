<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been alone for a while, and I&rsquo;m getting old(30+), I started feeling the urgency to get a partner in crime. So I asked around, people always ask back &ldquo;what kind of girl are you looking for? &quot; I hate not able to articulate that well, so I decided to write it down, since there is nothing secret about it.</p>
<p>Basically I&rsquo;m looking for a girl who is just like me, sound quite narcissistic, but that&rsquo;s my genuine feeling. Maybe because I&rsquo;m quite self-contained and happy, I don&rsquo;t really want to break it, and I&rsquo;ve seen some couples hold quite different values / lifestyles, and living together unhappy, I don&rsquo;t want to be like that.</p>
<p>Of course people are different, something is easy for me might be difficult for another person. I can take compromise, I just dump them all out of my mind, we can treat them as reference, not rules.</p>
<h2 id="values-i-look-for">Values I look for</h2>
<h3 id="positive--optimistic">Positive / optimistic</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimistic and happy person in general, and I value it. I live by hope, as opposite to not fear, stress or other stuff. I&rsquo;m happy to see progress or improvement, that&rsquo;s the main driver for my day to day life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to work / live with negative / pessimistic person, even though I know sometimes I know their points are valid, but if there is no hope or action taken place, I&rsquo;d not enjoy whining about them.</p>
<p>This is not to see we don&rsquo;t complain or try to solve problem, people around me probably know I&rsquo;m quite critical on lots of things, and I see it as a tough love, and hoping to change.</p>
<h3 id="receptive--open-minded">Receptive / Open-minded</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m from China, as much as I love American/Western culture, I can&rsquo;t deny that deep down I&rsquo;m still a Chinese. I think ideally she is Asian descendant or into Asian culture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite open-minded, and I enjoy learning new things(tools/ideas/concepts), and anything contributes my self-improvement.</p>
<p>For example, in this year 2022, I&rsquo;ve embarked fermentation journey(Sauerkraut, Kombucha, kamichi, yogurt etc), learning MBTI and stoicism, just to name a few, and I&rsquo;ve probably invested 100+ hours in each of them, and I&rsquo;d be thrilled to talk about them anytime.</p>
<p>Not necessary my partner needs to like/agree whatever I&rsquo;m pursuing, but I hope to see she has similar mindset, ideally we can learn and grow together.</p>
<h3 id="supportive-feminine">Supportive, feminine</h3>
<p>My ideal partner would be compassionate, loving, considerate etc, just some common feminine traits I guess.<br>
I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;male chauvinistic&rdquo; person, on the contrary, I see myself as a moderate feminist. I like independent people, but strong-minded/feisty female would not my ideal choice.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyles-i-look-for">Lifestyles I look for</h2>
<h3 id="abstraction-vs-sensing">Abstraction vs Sensing</h3>
<p>In MBTI parlance, I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;Ni&rdquo; (Introverted Intuitive) person, I&rsquo;m drawn into abstraction(not tangible materials/experience).</p>
<p>For example, my common table topics are economy, business, power, psychology, tools(software, ideas, little gadgets) etc, and I often found myself despise those material, superficial, sensual stuff / experience. For example, fine dining, clothing, &ldquo;excessive cleaning&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>Bringing this up not to put it as a requirement but to seek understanding, I know lots of people are not like me, I can understand it. And I hope my partner understand it as well.</p>
<h3 id="emotion">Emotion</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite emotionally stable, and I value it. I&rsquo;ve seen many people are not, and not even working on it, nor see it as a problem, that&rsquo;s a big problem to me.</p>
<p>I believe in stoicism, the very essence idea is accepting what you can&rsquo;t control and having the courage to change what you can, and having the wisdom to tell the difference.</p>
<p>Maintain a consistent light mood is essential for me, I don&rsquo;t expect everyone, me included could achieve that easily, we could work on that at least.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>I live quite modestly overall, I often joke about that my spending ability is like a new grad, and I&rsquo;m actually proud of it. I came from a humble beginning, I have always been living below my means, I guess it probably applicable for most immigrants.</p>
<p>So I probably won&rsquo;t be happy with people enjoy luxurious (money-wise) lifestyle. I don&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t indulge ourselves with some worldly pressure, we certainly can, but just do it sparingly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in investing, currently I&rsquo;m mainly invested in risky assets (stock and crypto), I&rsquo;d gradually move some of them to Real Estate and other safer assets. I hope my partner would not be a risk-averse person.</p>
<h3 id="active">Active</h3>
<p>I like all kinds of sports and workout, I enjoy maintaining a fit body. I hope my partner would enjoy physical active as well, and we can do something like hiking, kayaking in spare time.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end</h2>
<p>There you have it, just primarily &ldquo;Values&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifestyles&rdquo;, of course there are lots of others things I care, but above are just things top off my mind.</p>
