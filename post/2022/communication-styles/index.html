    <h3 id="how-it-started">How it started</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know there is a thing called &ldquo;communication styles&rdquo; until I started preparing a Toastmaster speech and I took the quiz, I got 5/12 in <strong>Supportive style</strong>, 4/12 in <strong>Direct style</strong>, 2/12 in initiating, 1/12 in analytical. So Supportive and Direct are my dominant communication styles.</p>
<p>It does make sense as much as I know myself, actually they&rsquo;re pretty much aligned with how I interact with other people in general, I&rsquo;m glad that they&rsquo;re aligned. I&rsquo;m a combination of supportive(shy, indecisive, slow, risk-averse) and Direct(confident, competitive, independent, and risk-taking). Some people might be wondering, how could these two be reconciled in one person? Well, let me explain.</p>
<h3 id="supportive-style">Supportive Style</h3>
<p>First the supportive style, in another word as myself noticed, lacking of leadership and initiative. I&rsquo;m a passionate person in general, I like to talk and engage with others in the area I&rsquo;m interested in, for example, stock market, programming, psychology etc. But I rarely initialize any conversation or activity I&rsquo;m passionate about, instead, I would listen to the people around me, and choose whether I should follow. I make my preference and lifestyle quite supple and diverse so I can be quite adaptive with different people, it&rsquo;s not easy for me to not have a good time.</p>
<p>For example, these days I go to rock climbing twice a week with my roommate Eric because he is kinda passionate about it, he has been doing it since he was a teen, and he is quite good at it. I learned a lot from him, I do enjoy it, I invested a lot of time and energy in it, I can see myself doing it in foreseeable future, but I would probably won&rsquo;t start without him.</p>
<p>I started semi-serious body building workout because then roommate Bimal was passionate about body building, he has got a quite physique, I was influenced by him, I used to go to gym with him 3 times a week while I was in Charlotte, now I moved out but kept the workout routine by myself.</p>
<p>When I was working in office (before pandemic), my co-worker sitting next to me Jeremy was so passionate about playing Table Tennis, I was influenced by him, I ended up investing lots of time and energy in playing Pingpong with him.</p>
<p>The list could go on and on throughout my life, I like to hang out with passionate person, and I do enjoy being a supportive follower. I do hope one day I could stand up in the limelight and be the leader/influencer and get some followers.</p>
<!-- The supportive style is calm, steady, approachable, and often perceived as careful, patient and amiable. --> 
<!-- In a hindsight, even though I'm not a social person, but I do enjoy occasional social activities, I always try to be positive and supportive in the communities I'm in. --> 
<h2 id="direct-style">Direct style</h2>
<p>Well, there is another side of me, the &ldquo;direct&rdquo; me, and I often being called blunt for it. And I&rsquo;m Okay with it, it&rsquo;s hard for me to mince words when the hard cold true is in front of my face. I am an empathetic person, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t feel for others, but my preferred way of handling conflict/confusing/mystery is facing it head on, some people might not like it, and I probably can adjust accordingly when I notice, but that&rsquo;s not easy or natural for me.</p>
<p>For example, last time in a party one of my friend Bishal approached me and asked a question which he&rsquo;s asked me many times, &ldquo;Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin?&rdquo; I replied without thinking for a second: &ldquo;Yes, of course it&rsquo;s a good time, nobody can really time the market, so anytime is a good time! And don&rsquo;t ask me the same question, please!&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Okay&rdquo; and walked away, I knew he was a bit offended or disappointed, and I&rsquo;m Okay with it, I wanted to let him know I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Yes, I literally told him &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me the same question&rdquo;, which some people might frown upon on this &ldquo;rudeness&rdquo;. I wasn&rsquo;t being rude but just direct in my own view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to tell when would I being &ldquo;direct&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s when things/topics fall into my passionate area, things/topics I&rsquo;ve invested a lot.</p>
<p>Sometimes I found myself very opinionated on some ideas, for example, I like CLI tools a lot, Vim is the best editor, I believe in Bitcoin, crypto and Blockchain etc. When things/ideas fall into the very limited area which I&rsquo;ve invested a lot in, I became confident, emboldened and direct.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-end">In the end</h3>
<p>There you have it, for things are not in my specialty or passionate area, I tend to supportive. For things I have confidence or invested heavily in, I tend to be direct.</p>
