<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>I have nothing against holidays, nor celebrations, but for myself I just don&rsquo;t see the need to celebrate most of them. I could take the time off and do something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do, something like wring this blog, that&rsquo;s how I appreciate the holiday!</p>
<p>Mostly holidays are propelled by merchants trying to sell their products, I think most people are already well-aware of this. We live in this overabundant world, we already have way more than we should have, actually having too many either physical items / celebrations / connections are not making us happy, on the contrary, having less of them would probably do the job, at least it works well for me.</p>
<p>Especially I&rsquo;m from a different culture, I&rsquo;m often being &ldquo;coerced&rdquo; or pressured by social media that I need to do something for two sets of holidays, I&rsquo;m happier don&rsquo;t do them all when I don&rsquo;t feel like to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúConformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.‚Äù ‚Äì John F. Kennedy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always despised conformity, both consciously and unconsciously. Everybody do the same thing at the same time just sound wrong to me, just think about the rush hour traffic.</p>
<p>Not only boring but also introducing unnecessary comparison &amp; competitions. That&rsquo;s one of the reason I refuse to wear suit / uniform, especially for work, I could be brainwashed by Silicon Valley anti-corp culture.</p>
<p>In my Emotional reasoning it could be that I wasn&rsquo;t raised in a very loving environment in childhood, my parents did raise me and my brother decently but not enough love and care I think, that&rsquo;s a long story, I&rsquo;ve got used to it. I don&rsquo;t long for the old good feelings in my childhood, because they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>In my logic reasoning, holiday is just another form of conformity, for those stories might not true or relevant to us, just doesn&rsquo;t seem fun. Sometimes we do just need an reason to have fun / party, then go for it.</p>
<p>In my logic reasoning, holiday is mostly propelled by commercials to sell their products/ads, there is nothing wrong with that, just I don&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel obligated to celebrate or need to be with someone in certain time, unless it really means something for myself.</p>
<p>Even birthday each year has started losing grip on me, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything besides something on paper, I do hope I&rsquo;d have set some personal milestones in each year, so I could make it a bit more &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; to myself, but I never pulled it off. ü•≤</p>
<p>I value and practice consistency.</p>
<p>I learned the practice from ÊùéÁ¨ëÊù•, that taking a huge break in holiday is unnecessary
I try to avoid unnecessary &ldquo;context change&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="not-only-eating">Not only eating</h3>
<h3 id="fasting">Fasting</h3>
<p>detox
less is more
food, internet,</p>
<p>For example, I started practicing intermittent fasting over 6 months ago, I realized I&rsquo;ve got way better appetite on eating, I can keep eating the same food every single day (I don&rsquo;t, but I really could) and still found them satisfying, it makes my life way easier.
At the end of day, we all want to be health, but lots of healthy food can&rsquo;t satisfied our tongue, but guess what, just simply eating less could do the job, by eating less, we could get more time to do something else, isn&rsquo;t that great?</p>
<p>I think it applies to holidays as well, I don&rsquo;t think most of people are thrilled to celebrate holidays, they don&rsquo;t even enjoy the food that much these days.
If we could set aside some big tasks to do right before the holiday, and conflate the holiday celebration with personal celebration, that would ideal. So simply just fasting few days, whether is water fasting, fruit fasting or whatever, we could have way better appetite for the holiday food.</p>
