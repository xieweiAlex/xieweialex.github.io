    <h2 id="motivation-for-writing-this">Motivation for writing this</h2>
<p>I have always liked to share &ndash; what I have learned, what excites me and what I&rsquo;m pondering, more often than not, people around me are not jazzed about them.</p>
<p>Which it&rsquo;s understandable actually, we live in an information over-loaded world, everybody has their social media feed constant feeding them. I figured at least I can write them down for my own future reference. If it could help or inspire someone, that&rsquo;s a bonus.</p>
<h2 id="quote-im-pondering">Quote I&rsquo;m pondering</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An unexamined life is not worth living - Socrates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I&rsquo;m getting old, I started feeling that I&rsquo;ve wasted so much time not making conscious decisions in my past 30 or so life, More of then not, the friends I&rsquo;ve got in life, the school I went, the job I got etc, most majority of them just chose out of situation instead of long term planning, and I rarely examine them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I started writing journals ~5 years ago, I&rsquo;ve accumulated tons of journals in plain text, which could be a fortune for my future self exploring with the help of AI (LLM and NLP).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diversification is‚Äîas practiced generally‚Äîmakes very little sense for anyone that knows what they‚Äôre doing&hellip;it is a protection against ignorance&quot; - Warren Buffet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was super concentrated in tech and got burnt in 2022 and was on the edge of getting margin called on Robinhood, I learned the lesson and had been diversifying ever since.</p>
<p>But in my own nature I know deeply that I can&rsquo;t be a hands-off investor, I yearn for the volatility and the associated risk award, as long as I know what I&rsquo;m doing, I have fun playing it, and of course I&rsquo;m not a gambler because I do lots of research and I generally hold very long.</p>
<p>YTD I have been buying in Bitcoin, Tesla and Ark ETFs heavily and frequently, and shed some individual growth stocks which I don&rsquo;t really know much, it feels so good when the whole market tumbles and I can buy them in discount.</p>
<h2 id="life-style--habit-changes">Life style / Habit changes</h2>
<h3 id="kimchi-and-fermenting">Kimchi and fermenting</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fermenting for a while thanks for the &ldquo;fermentation enthusiasts&rdquo; meetup group led by Gagan, and I&rsquo;ve made some batches of yogurt, kefir, Sauerkraut, Kombucha etc. But I&rsquo;ve been putting Kimchi off for quite a while, finally I got it started, I made two patches this month.</p>
<p>As always, it&rsquo;s not that hard, whenever I&rsquo;m very happy about taking the first step of doing something brand new, I always regret I didn&rsquo;t try it earlier. I guess my passion has waned, I&rsquo;ve learned quite a few ferments, and I got complacent, which it&rsquo;s fine, I can take a break and optimize/streamline what I&rsquo;ve already explored.</p>
<h3 id="bookkeeping-beancount">Bookkeeping, Beancount</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do bookkeeping, not to save money but to encourage myself to spend more, lol. I&rsquo;m too frugal, I know it, but I need to understand my spending before I can let loose more freely.</p>
<p>And the tool I&rsquo;m using it&rsquo;s called <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/">Beancount</a>, a double-entry accounting tool, I will write another blog post about it.</p>
<h2 id="new-tools">New tools</h2>
<h3 id="nas">NAS</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always known the importance of backing up data, and I&rsquo;ve lost some important data(mostly about photos), but the frictions of plugging in and off a hard disk just put me off, thanks for Shane&rsquo;s encouragement, I started exploring NAS.</p>
<p>NAS stands for Network attachment System, basically it hard-wired with Ethernet and provide the accessibility for any device in the same local network fore reading &amp; writing, it&rsquo;s that simple, but it opens lots of possibilities.</p>
<p>I should write a blog post about it.</p>
<h3 id="proxy-server">Proxy server</h3>
<p>I love chatGPT so much that our company blocked it on VPN frustrated me üôÅ. Since I have an old laptop collecting dust, I figured I could use it as a proxy server for VPN and my on duty laptop be an client, that&rsquo;s such a brilliant idea. All credit to Shane, again!</p>
<p>The idea is simple, but implementation is a bit difficult actually, as a self-professed geek I have to say I lack of computer network knowledge. Thanks Shane helping me hand by hand.</p>
<h3 id="steaming-pod">Steaming Pod</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always known steaming is one of the healthiest way of cooking, and it&rsquo;s very easy to do so. Finally I got a steaming pot from Amazon Prime day for ~$30, that&rsquo;s such a steal!</p>
<p>And I love it so much, it&rsquo;s one of the best ROI tool I&rsquo;ve bought recently, lol. It&rsquo;s so easy to cook and prep, though a bit hard to clean, it introduces way more veggies in my diet, one stone hits multiple birds. üòÜ</p>
<h2 id="struggles">Struggles</h2>
<h3 id="neck-pain">Neck pain</h3>
<p>I struggle with neck pain on daily basis, it hurts me both physically and mentally. Sometimes it gets too bad that I can not think about anything but just lay down or doom-scroll on social media (short videos!), I hate it so much! üò°</p>
<p>I started doing some neck exercise every day since last week, I hope it could alleviate the pain, otherwise I would have to visit Chiropractics or physical therapies.</p>
<p>Or even consider a surgery maybe, that&rsquo;s a terrifying idea to even think about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q12nIfVCpdU">Neck Pain Relief Exercises in 5 min</a></p>
<h3 id="loneliness">Loneliness</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have many close friends and I feel lonely every now and then. (it&rsquo;s Okay to admit it, the loneliness epidemic is real,  especially for men ü§∑ )</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me be vulnerable or negative with people. I heard there is a common belief that &ldquo;Most of the men, their romantic partner is the sole channel to share their vulnerabilities, thus men are easier get depressed after breakup&rdquo;. The toxic masculinity is bad for both men and women I believe, it&rsquo;s a cultural thing, not something I can solve.</p>
<p>Having some community connections could definite help, I&rsquo;m grateful I that have Bitcoin and Fermentation community in Dallas.</p>
<p>I have a lot of hobbies, e.g. Skateboard, self-improvement, stock market, Stoicism, computer hacks, Vim etc, each of them I probably could get some like-minded friends, I just need to find the right community or even start my own. ü§©</p>
