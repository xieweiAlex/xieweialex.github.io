<li>
<p>We are running out of toilet paper, our household about to in a essential deficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li>All of sudden I saw some toilet paper rolls available in the bodega nearby, I bought two packs for $24, that&rsquo;s really overpriced.</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s a lesson learned, even though it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to stockpile them, but if everybody started doing that, we are coerced to get into the trend otherwise we gonna end up having nothing when we really need. That&rsquo;s lose lose solution, that&rsquo;s why we need a leader in bad situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of sick of those nonsense rumors, unreasonable nationalism, anti-West culture semantics in Wechat community, I hope I can find my community or create one for my own sanity health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I almost watch stand up comedian shows every day, I feel I started getting most of jokes, I&rsquo;m becoming more sarcastic and funny, I like it. üòè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had first experience wearing face mask in super market, it was awkward, we started taking it seriously.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was awkward, my eyeglasses getting blurred all the time, I have to constantly adjusting the masks or eyeglasses on my face using my hands which had touched various random items, that&rsquo;s worse than don&rsquo;t wear anything üòÖ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started seriously playing skateboard finally, I knew I gonna love it, I really love, but I overestimate the difficulty of playing tricks. I thought I have good balance, it turned out not that much.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="week-2">Week 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I cut hair myself again after pausing for months, it was close to good enough, but who cares üôÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I joined Toastmasters and gave my first public speech, it was fun and relax.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t know I was actually very nervous until I listened the recording. It was embarrassing, I laughed a lot on the stage for nothing üòÖ, I kept saying &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, yeah&rdquo; for no reason or rhyme, it&rsquo;s awkward to listen.</li>
<li>I was never comfort giving speech in public even in Chinese, I do become much more confidence and outward then years ago, but it still takes time, I can understand that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I finally start getting my early up plan doing seriously, I have failed at 100 times since my youth age, I feel I gonna nail it this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m happy for my resilience or thick face to say it public. üòÉ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting the monthly report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting working from home.</p>
<ul>
<li>I asked my manager I&rsquo;d like to work from home since the following Monday, and I didn&rsquo;t give a due date intentionally, he was cool with that. I was the first person asking working from home, and since then (starting of Monday week 2), I haven&rsquo;t went back office yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started the Green Card applying process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks Adil&rsquo;s nomination and solid performance recognition. But I&rsquo;m not sure how it will go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
