<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinating by good tools, let me just record what tools I found amazed me and regret I didn&rsquo;t try it later.</p>
<h3 id="footrest--toning-ball-for-my-stiff-neck">Footrest &amp; toning ball for my stiff neck</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been suffered from neck stiffness for years, I knew it&rsquo;s because my sedentary lifestyle, I can&rsquo;t change it significantly. I did notice whenever I sit in front of my desk, my hands put on the surface of desk, the pressure either goes to my shoulder or I lay down more it goes to my lower back, no other way around. Until I found the footrest, it only takes $10+ bucks, I can vivid aware some of my upper body pressure goes to my foot which is awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always stretching my body every once in a while in a day is a good habit, specially for my stiff neck. All of sudden I notice the toning ball in grocery outlet only cost $5 bucks, I used it to do any stretching all the time. Stretching is using my own body weight momentum to stretch, why don&rsquo;t I do it with some more weight, and the toning ball is very soft and comfort.</p>
<h3 id="true-color-for-terminal-vim">True color for Terminal Vim</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been bothered by the anemic UI support in terminal vim. It&rsquo;s just so bland and primitive, before that I thought I don&rsquo;t care about UI at all, it taught me I do care in a low level. I turned to Mac Vim for years for the basic UI support. Now things turn around, the terminal vim has better color and contrast then MacVim, it might be a game changer, I might turn back to terminal vim and work with Tmux multiple windows and sessions.</p>
<h3 id="vim-smoothie-plugin">Vim smoothie plugin</h3>
<p>This plugin is recommend from email subscription of &ldquo;Mastering Vim quickly&rdquo;, at beginning I was suspicious of this unpopular plugin which just has 100+ stars in Github then. I gave it a try, it struck me after I used it for few minutes❗.</p>
<p>I never thought the scrolling in Vim should be smooth, why not 😄? I can never go back.</p>
<h3 id="google-photos">Google photos</h3>
<p>I went to Google photos just for the unlimited photo uploading for free (with some photo quality losing which is acceptable for me). As a person not that sensitive to privacy, I like Google a lot. I can lost or break my phone anytime, the most valuable assets are the photos/videos in my phone, it&rsquo;s better have a cloud backup, automatically, painlessly.</p>
<h3 id="tig---rebase-interactive-for-git">Tig &amp;  rebase interactive for Git</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved Git, I admire stability and versatility in Git so much (Tho I started wondering Git does have bug, it struck me again since Git as an open source software we all assume it doesn&rsquo;t have bug).</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m kind of getting sick of the inconsecutive commands in Git, the most notorious is the <code>git stash</code>, it&rsquo;s just so inconvient to check them up or clean them, lots of time we end up with tons of stash list we even can&rsquo;t tell what are those shit inside, and we had to drop them all in batch which is bad practice. Another one like showing the content in the commit one by one is just drudgery work in terminal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved those commands have the simplicity and easy to pipe ability in terminal, I thought I don&rsquo;t care about UX much, Tig changed my idea, I do care. Tig provide the nice interactive terminal UI interface, I can make lots commands in consecutive, that&rsquo;s awesome!</p>
<p>Another one is <code>git rebase interactive</code>, I&rsquo;ve been amazed by how powerful and well-thought out about this subcommand. It might worth taking another post to illustrate, it gives me the ability and granular control of change history, like dancing in my repo, it&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
