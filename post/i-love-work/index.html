<p>I always heard people saying &ldquo;work life balance&rdquo;, as a bachelor, I don&rsquo;t have much personal life, it&rsquo;s hard for me separate work and life. I heard Jeff bezos says &ldquo;Work life harmony&rdquo;, yes, I&rsquo;m totally down with that.</p>
<h3 id="i-got-paid-constantly-with-considerable-salary">I got paid constantly with considerable salary</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to deny programmers got paid very decently nowadays comparing other profession, the market is booming, lots of opportunities available all the time, it&rsquo;s a good time. The whole society is moving digitalization and we are just started, i know there are would be even more opportunities in the perceivable future, I&rsquo;m moving the same directino with the world. I know I&rsquo;m making positive contribution to the world, I feel safe.</p>
<h3 id="its-good-for-my-career-growth">It&rsquo;s good for my career growth</h3>
<p>Work environment is my backyard playground where I can play, I got all the good office supplies, product design, UI/UX resources, they&rsquo;re all there support my play, how can i don&rsquo;t feel grateful. I can image myself start my own project which these support (maybe I should find one). I like to work with others, I always learning from people around me. With decent big enough project, I got the chance to play, to meet a problem and solve it with others&rsquo; support and praise, it&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
<p>Specially I&rsquo;m committed to programming, I know I won&rsquo;t be out of programming for the near future, all I&rsquo;m doing is building a good foundation for myself. I image myself being a technical architect and tell others all your struggles or hardwork I&rsquo;ve met when I was young, I went though it, I have good knowledge and experience to be a mentor when I want to be.</p>
<p>Working in a company helps me understand how a business works in the society, I know I will start my own business someday. It&rsquo;s fascinating to build a product the whole society likes it, build a team which everybody is having fun during work, allure people like my working together and build the future.</p>
<h3 id="it-helps-build-myself">It helps build myself</h3>
<p>I always learning from people around me, but I need a project work on (A battle to fight), I really enjoy working with people I admire and a project is rewarding, the process keeps teaching me how to do things, how the world or society works.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t deny I got so much influence from my daily work to my life, maybe because I don&rsquo;t have much personal life for now, but I enjoy it. I committed to the IT revolution. I feel like I got rebuild from work constantly, I always feel I might become a robot in the future, of course I don&rsquo;t want to, but I&rsquo;m interested to see how it goes.</p>
