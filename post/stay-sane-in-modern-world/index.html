<h3 id="body-language">Body language</h3>
<p>In what ways can body language express emotion?
Why is eye contact with your audience an important part of your speech?
How can facial expressions enhance the content of your message?
Why is too much body movement distracting for an audience?
Why is it important to be aware of cultural differences in the use of body language?</p>
<p>Body language is the nonverbal expression of emotions, feelings, and ideas. Your posture, movement, position, gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions all contribute to the message you send when you speak. Your body language can enhance your communication or undermine your message.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-stay-sane-in-this-over-abundant-world">How do I stay sane in this over-abundant world</h2>
<p>Hello fellow toastmasters, today we are gonna talk about sanity and over-abundance.</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you feel overwhelmed by excessive notification everyday, raise your hand if your todo list keeps piling up, how about read later list? And checkout list etc etc. I see some hands there. Trust me, you&rsquo;re not alone, this is a common problems, and we all go through them together.</p>
<p>The [[frustration]] of not able to get things done, the [[ temptation ]] of checking what&rsquo;s going on out there in internet, or how my friends doing in social media.</p>
<p>Here 3 tips I&rsquo;d like to share today, 1. Be selective 2. Do things thematically 3. Letting them go.</p>
<h3 id="be-selective">Be selective</h3>
<p>First, be selective, by treating things different in priority and time. For example, most content we consume everyday they&rsquo;re just news, and they&rsquo;re most probably one-sided arguments, before dust settle down, they all subjected to change. I subscribed lots of newsletter in email and lots of channel in Youtube, I try to read news in fast speed, most just skimming, grabbing the headline and keywords. If there are infomation I missed, that&rsquo;s fine, they would come back to my ears in another way most probably. Same applies to videos or podcast, I usually do fast speed 1.5x or even 2x. This makes my information consuming way more intense and fulfilling, ofc it takes some practice in order to make you feel well.</p>
<h3 id="do-things-thematically">Do things thematically</h3>
<p>For those timeless knowledge and insight, I&rsquo;ve got more time to consume them carefully, thoroughly and repeatedly. I&rsquo;ve been trying to build my own personal knowledge management system, aka &ldquo;second brain&rdquo;, I dump all those resources I need to review and explore inside by tagging.</p>
<p>This leads to my 2nd tips, do thing thematically. Whenever I want to learn something, I try to pull multiple resources either on internet or from my second brain, books, blog posts, videos from multiple people, most of the time their ideas are quite similar, if not the same, ofc there are a lot of nuance, and different interpretation, that&rsquo;s the fun part, I can compare them back and forth, I found this way to learn is way easier, I can read way faster, I can understand way deeper.</p>
<!-- For externally, I tried to categorize infomation as news and knowledge. For news, I only consume credited source, or independent media which I know well. I try do skim read in newsletter, speed watch/listen in video or audio, I don't mind missing some of the content, I will inevitable got to know the news if they really matter to me. -->  
<!-- Context switching is very expensive, I like multi-tasking, but I'd like to group them by on priority, intensity or just how they could enhance each other. For example, I'm a morning person, and I'm a mission driven person as well, I would get more energy and motivation if I get meaningful things done, instead of feeling tried. So usually I set aside 2-3 hours for critical tasks, things like my work, or preparing this speech, I'd feel satisfied and calm the rest of day. -->  
<h3 id="letting-it-go">Letting it go</h3>
<p>The last one is letting it go. There is no shortcut for achieving anything meaningful or worth persuing. You can&rsquo;t get ripped without working out everyday, you can&rsquo;t get rich without working your tail off, you can</p>
<p>Infatuation</p>
<p>get ripped
stock market guru
Any sports</p>
<p>FOMO</p>
<p>let the desire go, let the unrealist infatuation go.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall to the consumerism trap,</p>
<p>There is no shortcut,</p>
<p>No breaking news, the sky is not falling, no need to be connected 24/7</p>
