<h3 id="in-the-backdrop">In the Backdrop</h3>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been in the workforce for 10+ years, since I graduated from college. Well, I did take a little break for around 6 months to prepare for the GRE exam and come to the US. But they are not break, let alone vacation or reset. The preparation and Master program were intense, and I didn&rsquo;t have time nor energy to step back and analyze my situations.</p>
<p>However, during that time, I finally got the chance to read the <a href="http://cn.linux.vbird.org/linux_basic/linux_basic.php">È∏üÂì•ÁöÑLinuxÁßÅÊàøËèú</a> online book that I had been wanting to read for years. It was so satisfying to finally have the time for it. And that&rsquo;s when I realized how much I love Linux. Doing all that research and learning that I yearned for years was a great experience. I miss it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 8+ years since I first started my journey in the US. While I&rsquo;m proud of how far I&rsquo;ve come in terms of my English, financial stability, and overall professional skills. I have to admit, I&rsquo;m not completely satisfied with where I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work for various companies in different industries, from being an iOS engineer to handling Backend and Devops tasks. But in a hindsight, they were more or less arbitrary, my career trajectory is not well designed, and I hope going forward it could be more consistent and intentional. ‚úä</p>
<h3 id="career-path">Career Path</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loved every role, but the last couple of years, I&rsquo;ve been itching to dive into the world of Bitcoin, crypto, Finance/DeFi and cyber security. Time for a new adventure! Actually there have been a couple of opportunities, but I don&rsquo;t have the needed skills, which it&rsquo;s a shame. ü§∑</p>
<p>I often kick myself for not making important decisions sooner. Take my recent switching to Backend job position, for example. I had the feeling I would love it, even though it&rsquo;s quite challenging. And guess what? I was right. I enjoy it so much that I have never thought about going back, but it took me a solid 5 years of self-doubting, yearning and hesitating before I took the plunge.</p>
<p>I have always been a wimp. I can admit it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a go-getter, instead I kept wondering when the best opportunity, but during all that time, I wasn&rsquo;t even preparing for it. Duh!! üò¶</p>
<p>So, why didn&rsquo;t I just brush up on my Backend skills in my free time? Well, to be honest, I have quite some other interests that keep me pretty occupied.</p>
<p>And also, I&rsquo;m not the type of person who can lock him/her self in a room for hours and forget about the world, I&rsquo;m quite modest by nature, maybe that&rsquo;s just an excuse.</p>
<p>Making a big career change requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and I don&rsquo;t think I could handle that while juggling a full-time job. I could keep wondering &ldquo;what if&rdquo; for years and end up regretting it.</p>
<h3 id="life--relationship">Life &amp; Relationship</h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;m getting older, I started yearning for a settled life with a stable relationship. However, I don&rsquo;t see it happening in the US for me anytime soon. It&rsquo;s no secret that Asian men, especially immigrants, face challenges in the dating scene here. But that&rsquo;s a whole other topic.</p>
<p>Being single definitely has its perks. I&rsquo;ve had plenty time to entertain myself, and I have learned a lot about who I am and what I look for. I&rsquo;ve found peace and contentment in my own company, which I believe is crucial. But I&rsquo;m ready for a change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to exploring new places where I might have better luck. I&rsquo;ve already embraced the nomadic lifestyle after all.</p>
<h3 id="new-opportunities">New Opportunities</h3>
<p>I aspire to become a global citizen, appreciating both American and Asian cultures. It is only natural for me to desire to live in various Asian countries (besides China) before settling down in the US.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is a vibrant region with a large population, yet it is not as developed as other parts of the world. This presents a plethora of opportunities, in my opinion. With China&rsquo;s remarkable economic growth over the past 30 years, and its recent slowdown, it is likely that many opportunities will arise in the southern region.</p>
<p>At the very least, I could establish a software development team there to take advantage of the lower labor costs.</p>
<p>Also I&rsquo;m very interested in algorithmic trading, especially for crypto, I have been trading/investing in stock market for years, I really enjoy it, there are so much technical analysis skills that I need to learn and holding me back right now, I can see myself being a quant one day and proud of it.</p>
<p>However, I have to admit there are so much for me to learn in terms of technical analysis skills, which is holding me back. Nevertheless, I can see my passion towards it, and the huge opportunity, I can become a successful quant in future and that would be so much fun.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-end-tie-those-loose-ends">In the end, tie those loose ends</h3>
<p>Aside from all of those serious matters, I have a long list of books that I would like to finish reading, as well as numerous tools that I would like to focus on more, such as Beancount, Vim (Nvim), Anki, and Sparrow wallet.</p>
<p>I am also tired of being a consumer. I yearn to actively participate in projects and make a meaningful contribution. The concept of building in public is intriguing and I am eager to embark on this journey. I&rsquo;m ready for it! ‚úä</p>
