<h3 id="the-meaning-of-social">The Meaning of Social</h3>
<p>I have never been a social person. Parties and social gatherings are rarely enjoyable for me, and I struggle to connect with others in those settings.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve grown older, I&rsquo;ve come to realize the importance of breaking out of my friend/work cycle. It&rsquo;s become clear to me that staying in this routine can be limiting, especially when I&rsquo;m not satisfied with my current situation (which is often the case).</p>
<p>I find it both engaging and productive to join hobby-based meetups, whether online or offline. I especially enjoy events with a specific theme or topic, as it gives me the opportunity to do some research beforehand. However, I must admit that I often don&rsquo;t have time to do so. Unlike generic social events, hobby-based meetups allow us to connect with others who share same passions or interests. Unfortunately, my hobbies, such as Bitcoin and the stock market, are not always relatable to others.</p>

<h3 id="active-vs-passive-learning">Active vs passive learning</h3>
<p>I have been reading &ldquo;Poor Charlie&rsquo;s Almanac&rdquo; this month, all thanks to the MoneyXYZ online book club. Without the public accountability and discussion opportunity, I would not have been able to dedicate such diligent time to reading it.</p>
<p>I realized the concept difference between  &ldquo;Active and Passive learning&rdquo;, when we listen to podcast or watch Youtube video, it&rsquo;s relaxing and we can just follow the lead of the author&rsquo;s thinking journey.</p>
<p>However, when we actively engage in learning, we are actively participating and taking an active role in the learning process. This can involve asking questions, discussing with others, and actively seeking out information and resources to deepen our understanding.</p>
<p>In passive learning, we are more of a passive recipient of information, whereas in active learning, we are actively seeking out and processing information to actively learn and understand.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not very efficient, as it&rsquo;s a one-size-fits-all approach. We all learn very differently for various reasons, some concepts might be easy for some people but hard to others, and vice versa. It&rsquo;s very important to take a pause and take notes in learning, and most importantly, learning requires getting back and regurgitate the content(at least for most people). You can argue most of media content we consume on-demand, we can pause and rewind, but to be honest, I don&rsquo;t think most people do it. Comparing with reading, we do it all the time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, passive learning can be a good way to relax and unwind, but it may not lead to the same level of understanding and retention as active learning.</p>
<h2 id="whats-happened">What&rsquo;s Happened</h2>
<p>This month, I experienced a major scare that left me feeling devastated and in disbelief. During my annual checkup, I received some concerning results that left me reeling. In a panic, I immediately reached out to my primary care provider and requested another test. To my relief, the results were completely different.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I realize that scheduling my appointment right after the Christmas party was not the best idea. I could have easily rescheduled, but I chose to consult with my doctor instead. Her advice to &ldquo;just not eat too many sweets&rdquo; seemed simple enough, but I should have been more cautious during this important yearly examination. Lesson learned!</p>

<h2 id="year-of-visualization">Year of Visualization</h2>
<p>After years of knowing about it, I have finally decided to pick up <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/intro/">Mermaid</a>. I am determined to take it seriously this time. I am drawn to the concept of having complete control over my plain text source files and being able to render it in remote host.</p>
<h2 id="delight">Delight</h2>
<h3 id="readerhttpsreadwiseioread"><a href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader</a></h3>
<p>After hearing countless praises for Reader, I decided to give it a try as I&rsquo;m already a paid user of Readwise(They&rsquo;re from the same company). I was blown away by its excellent UI/UX design, shortcuts oriented design, and multiple functions. I am absolutely in love with it!</p>
<p>But the best part is that I am now free from the overwhelming amount of email newsletters. While I enjoy reading them, I often struggle to find the time to read them all. It was a constant source of stress for me, and I would often just mark them as &ldquo;Read&rdquo; without actually reading/skimming them. Reader has been a lifesaver for me, and I am grateful to have found it.</p>
<h3 id="lazyvimhttpswwwlazyvimorg"><a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/">LazyVim</a></h3>
<p>I have been a dedicated Vim user for nearly a decade, both Vim and Neovim. As a self-proclaimed Vim power user, I have not noticed much difference between the two, it says something. 😉 However, transitioning to Lazyvim is such a big deal. While it is still based on Vim, it comes highly pre-configured, which can feel like a betrayal to the DIY community.
Nevertheless, I have come to terms with the fact that I simply do not have the time to configure everything myself(I would never finish configuring my Vimrc). As my schedule becomes increasingly busy, I must prioritize my time and Lazyvim allows me to do just that.</p>
<h3 id="study-music-listhttpsmusicyoutubecomplaylistlistplcxhww4wavdjo8fwjquvhh05-xxhonu7xsi7sle9kbzo2ip-tuv"><a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCXhWW4WAvDjO8FWjquvhH05-XxHONU7x&amp;si=7sle9KbZO2IP-tUv">Study Music List</a></h3>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5acGzAC0OH4QDVj5hlFqlK?uid=b9f50d2b6b3649a3&amp;uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A64eRZGAmZQFxFQQq1z3aV2">Ali&rsquo;s study with me music list</a>, I enjoyed some of the episodes but not all of them, so I decided to create one on my own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so rewarding to listen my favorite thematic music while working or studying, as always, I kick myself for not starting it earlier.</p>
<h2 id="struggle">Struggle</h2>
<h3 id="cheap-dopamine">Cheap Dopamine</h3>
<p>I spent way more time in social media and IM groups than I should, I kick myself almost everyday on this, I know I can do better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for me to get rid of it since I was always like this, I realized I have this habit when I was in college that my then time girlfriend she can stay away from phone for hours without noticing, I was surprised. I always keep myself available in case people call/text me, I&rsquo;m not a big shot of any sort, it&rsquo;s very unnecessary.</p>
<h3 id="neck-pain">Neck Pain</h3>
<p>My neck pain still bothers me on weekly basis(if not daily), I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve found some neck stretch exercises. I just need to keep doing it every day, probably 10 mins a day would be suffice, it&rsquo;s not that hard, I can do it.</p>
