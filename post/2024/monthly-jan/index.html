<h3 id="the-meaning-of-social">The Meaning of Social</h3>
<p>I have never been a social person, it is rarely fun for me in party or social gatherings, nor is it easy for me to get to know people in those events.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;m getting older, I started seeing the importance of getting out of my friend/work cycle, especially when I&rsquo;m not content with what I have(I rarely am, but that&rsquo;s another topic).</p>
<p>I find it pretty fun and productive about joining hobby based meetups(online or offline), especially when there is theme/topic for the event, I&rsquo;d love to do some homework before I join, but I rarely do ðŸ˜„. In those generic social events, most of time we share what&rsquo;s our hobby anyway, and I find it very hard for me to letting people resonate with my hobbies, for example, Bitcoin and stock market.</p>

<h3 id="active-vs-passive-learning">Active vs passive learning</h3>
<p>I have been reading the book &ldquo;Poor Charlie&rsquo;s Almanac&rdquo; this month, thanks MoneyXYZ online book club, otherwise I would not have the motivation to read so dilligently.</p>
<p>I realized difference between &ldquo;Active and Passive learning&rdquo;, when we listen to podcast or watch Youtube video, it&rsquo;s relaxing and we just follow the lead of the thinking journey.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not very efficient, as it&rsquo;s a one-size-fits-all approach. We all learn very differently for various reasons, some concepts might be easy for some people but hard to others, and vice versa. It&rsquo;s very important to take a pause and take notes in learning, and most importantly, learning requires getting back and regurgitate the content(at least for most people). You can argue most of media content we consume on-demand, we can pause and rewind, but to be honest, I don&rsquo;t think most people do it. Comparing with reading, we do it all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Readwise for quite a while, I find the spaced repetition method working for me amazingly well. I knew the concept of &ldquo;Active vs Passive Learning&rdquo; very early on, but I didn&rsquo;t think deep about it. Thanks MoneyXYZ online reading club let me realize it.</p>
<h2 id="whats-happened">What&rsquo;s Happened</h2>
<p>There was a huge drama happened to me this month, I was almost devastated and in deep disbelif by the annual checkup result. I texted my primary care provider, and requested another test, then the result were worlds apart.</p>
<p>ðŸ˜‚ I should not have arranged an appointment right after the Christmas party, I had time to rearrange it, but I opted to consulting the doctor and she replied &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t eat too much sweet&rdquo;, lol, I trusted her. I should have err on the side of caution for this kind once in a year examine.</p>

<h2 id="year-of-visualization">Year of Visualization</h2>
<p>I finally picked up <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/intro/">Mermaid</a> after knowing it for years, lol, I gonna take it serious this time, I like the idea of self-custody my plain text source file and render it out in the end.</p>
<h2 id="delight">Delight</h2>
<h3 id="readerhttpsreadwiseioread"><a href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader</a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of raves about Reader, since I&rsquo;m already a Readwise paid user, I decided to give it a try. It&rsquo;s such a good product, well designed, short-cut oriented, multi-functional, I love it so much!</p>
<p>More importantly, I salvaged myself from the endless email newsletter, I love those email letters, but the issue is I can&rsquo;t finish reading them,  I had been agonized by the endless email list and most of time just blindly mark them as &ldquo;Read&rdquo; to keep my sanity. This is a life saver, I&rsquo;m so glad I found it.</p>
<h3 id="lazyvim">LazyVim</h3>
<p>I have been using Vim for almost a decade( Vim and Neovim), as a self-professed heavy Vim user, I actually don&rsquo;t see much difference from them. But moving to Lazyvim is big deal, even though everything is still vim based, but it&rsquo;s highly pre-configured, it&rsquo;s like a betrayal to the community spirit. But I have to face it, I don&rsquo;t have time to configure everything myself, the last decade I didn&rsquo;t finish it, as I get busier and busier, I need to preserve my time.</p>
<h3 id="study-music-list">Study music list</h3>
<p>Inspired by Ali&rsquo;s study with me music list, I decided to create one on my own, it&rsquo;s so easy and rewarding to listen my favorite non-lyric music while working or studying, I kick myself for not starting it earlier.</p>
<h2 id="struggle">Struggle</h2>
<h3 id="cheap-dopamine">Cheap Dopamine</h3>
<p>I spent way more time online in all kinds of social media, and I constantly kick myself at night that I was wasting time on them, I know I can do better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a habit I got for more than a decade, it&rsquo;s not easy to change. I realized when I was in college that my then time girlfriend she can stay away from phone for hours without noticing, and I have the habit of keeping myself available, and actually rarely anyone care, I need to change.</p>
<h3 id="neck-pain">Neck Pain</h3>
<p>The neck pain still bothers me every on weekly (if not daily) basis, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve found numerous neck stretch exercise, I just need to keep doing it every day, prob 10 mins a day, it&rsquo;s not that hard, I can do it.</p>
