<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing skateboard for over a year now, the more I learn and practice this sport, the more I like it. Though my skills are far away from a pro, but I don&rsquo;t need to be, I like this sport because of the benefits it gives back to me, the community I like and I can see myself playing it in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3 id="its-challenging-and-inspiring">It&rsquo;s challenging and inspiring</h3>
<p>One of my testimony of being a risk-taking person is that I like &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; sport, I like the high stakes moment, I found it while riding motorcycle in freeway, the adrenaline spike drives my soul.</p>
<p>Playing skateboard tricks are dangerous, there are not short stories about people got into hospital of minor mistakes. Actually just recently one of my favorite celebrity Nyja went to hospital for a surgery, but this doesn&rsquo;t stop him, won&rsquo;t stop me either.</p>
<p>What it brings to me?</p>
<p>Playing skateboard is not for a faint of heart, it&rsquo;s quite dangerous and challenging, and that makes it inspiring. There is no short of inspiring skateboarding videos in internet, in those half-pipes, those skate parks or common parks. Though those stunts are too far from amateur players like me I feel, but I can see myself playing it for years but not get bored.</p>
<p>Through playing those tricks, I&rsquo;ve gained so much better at balancing, nimbleness, and courage on taking challenges, these traits I cherish a lot in life.</p>

<p>Actually I severely underestimated the difficulty of those skateboard tricks when I started. I&rsquo;ve played roller skating for years, I was quite good at it, I thought I would ramp up in skateboard like a breeze, and I didn&rsquo;t. ðŸ˜… I spent months just to be able to Ollie on flat ground in still, it&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<!-- It's hard of course, but it's just a fundamental trick of another hundreds, I constant as I heard people saying some people can learn Ollie in a week, lots of people can not learn it in life time. And there is tons of other medium and advanced tricks to learn. I won't get bored for many years at least. -->

<p>There are numerous skateboard tricks circulating in internet, which are too bold, some people might despise their boldness, some might get aspired, I&rsquo;m the latter. I don&rsquo;t see myself can master those tricks anytime soon, but even just imaging one day I could do that already makes me excited.</p>
<p>The general stereotype of skateboarders are grassroots, rebellious, cantankerous, I like it, it&rsquo;s similar with people riding sport motorcycle, that makes me feel cool ðŸ˜Ž.</p>
<h3 id="convenience-affordability">convenience, affordability</h3>
<p>I can play alone, almost anywhere, and it&rsquo;s quite affordable comparing with any other sport.</p>
<p>I loved playing basketball when I was a teen, it&rsquo;s convenient, sophisticated and fun. But after I stopped growing vertically, and being short in height is such a disadvantage for playing basketball. I&rsquo;m very unhappy about it. I know that&rsquo;s not anybody&rsquo;s fault, I opted out despondently.</p>
<p>Recently there is a fad that lots of people fascinating into skiing or snowboarding, I&rsquo;ve always liked those balance required sport, especially snowboarding, it looks cool and I can play some tricks with it. I went to play a couple of times, and I found out it&rsquo;s not very good for me to take it seriously.</p>
<p>In most of area you can only play snowboard couple of months in a year, all base on the lenient of weather. Usually you have to drive couple of hours to the snow field, since it is not convenient to get there, people usually play many hours non stop from mountain top to bottom, I usually get bored playing 1 or 2 hours.</p>
<p>To me, playing snowboarding is more like a social sport, a group of people hitting there and play together is a typical theme. As I&rsquo;m not a social person(I&rsquo;m not anti-social in any means), one of the reason I loved basketball is I can play myself all alone and enjoy it, which you just can&rsquo;t do it in football, pingpong or tennis. I would expect the sports (or anything) I like, I spent most of time I&rsquo;m progressing myself alone, and some occasional chances we hit up some friends sparking ideas together.</p>
<p>One thing I like about skateboard is it doesn&rsquo;t require anything besides a board and willing. You can play in most of place you want, there isn&rsquo;t much cost or maintenance(I&rsquo;ve been tormenting my board for over a year, the maintenance is $0).</p>
