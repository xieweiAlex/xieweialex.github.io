    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Two years into the obnoxious pandemic, I&rsquo;ve got so used to WFH. Though I still struggle to figure out eating every day, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d ever go back to office on daily basis. A brand new work/life style is opening to us, I&rsquo;m so excited to see what would happen, I&rsquo;ve always dreamed to be a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-nomad.asp">digital nomad</a>.</p>
<p>I moved out of Bay Area in July, after staying there for 4 years, there are many happy and bitter memories, and I would probably forget them soon. I left quietly, no fuss. I will go back when I feel like to, it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>I finally transferred myself into Backend job position, I think I made the right decision, I never looked back, nor open the shitty clumsy Xcode üôÖ. I could finally use my favorite Vim editor to do my job, nothing makes me happier than this.</p>
<p>I spent most majority of my spare time this year in learning investing, there are so much hypes and excitement in stock &amp; crypto market 24/7, I learned a lot. But my portfolio has been drastically underperforming S&amp;P or QQQ index almost the whole year(peaked in Feb), it sucks!
But I&rsquo;m grateful that I got the blow early on in my investing journey, otherwise I&rsquo;d be cocky and get over myself easily, the setback doesn&rsquo;t really damp my enthusiasm, I know I&rsquo;m just starting out and I would catch up eventually. I enjoy doing it, not only for the return/result, that&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>I spent 1+ hour on average every day learning English on daily basis, mostly on expanding my vocabulary using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>, in my <a href="https://github.com/xieweiAlex/English_Learning">repo</a>. I&rsquo;ve get very comfortable with it, I used the practice 5+ years, though it&rsquo;s slow and I don&rsquo;t see it get done any time soon, but it&rsquo;s the best way I could figure out at this moment.</p>
<p>Looking back the last year, it&rsquo;s very much transformative, I&rsquo;m very happy about it. I settled 3 anchors for my life for the foreseeable years: Backend(Infra, security), investing(stock, crypto, Real Estate) and English(reading, speaking).<br>
Though I spent way too much time on stock market than anything else, way less time in BE learning-close to 0, it&rsquo;s a colossal mistake. At current stage of my life and foreseeable years, my primary income, social interaction, sense of safety, belongingness come from my work, and I suck at it, it agonizes me everyday.</p>
<h2 id="career-">Career ‚úÖ</h2>
<h3 id="vimtmux-setup-for-backend-development">Vim/tmux setup for backend development</h3>
<p>I spent a decent amount of time setting up my dev environment in terminal, Vim &amp; Tmux, they&rsquo;re awesome! I&rsquo;m so glad that I committed to them while there is nobody  around me on my side, it makes me feel a bit lonely, but I have a big online community, and they&rsquo;re huge! I&rsquo;m proud of myself for my commitment and advancement, I&rsquo;m still very green in those online communities, I need to work on it.</p>
<p>Post: Setup Vim as a full-fledged IDE, TBD.</p>
<h3 id="nodejs-devops-in-backend-getting-started">Node.js, Devops in backend getting started</h3>
<p>The journey of transferring into backend isn&rsquo;t easy, especially I&rsquo;m in platform team which mainly on Infra &amp; security, it&rsquo;s very challenging. There are tons of stuff I need to learn, and I need to learn on the go, I got lost all the time. I appreciate my company and my manager and my teammates gave me the chance to learn, the impostor syndrome haunts me every work day. I&rsquo;m sure I would get better next year.</p>
<p>Post: 1 year into Backend, TBD</p>
<h2 id="learning-">Learning ‚úÖ</h2>
<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p>Learning Vim is a life long journey, the more I learn the more I feel I&rsquo;m just getting started. I finished another book &ldquo;Mastering Vim quickly&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s quite easy for me to read, I learn most of those tricks &amp; concepts here and there in internet over the years.</p>
<p>Post: I use Vim everywhere, TBD</p>
<h3 id="stock-market-psychology-options-basics">Stock market psychology, Options basics</h3>
<p>Finished most part of Meetkevin&rsquo;s &ldquo;stock &amp; psychology of money&rdquo; course, Investopedia&rsquo;s stock option basics, and I spent huge amount of time reading Motley Fool and Investopedia&rsquo;s newsletter. Watched ÁæéÊäïÂêõ almost all the video on Youtube.
I like them so much from bottom of my heart, I like to be in the market, I like to trade/bet base on my knowledge, looking at the world/society through investor&rsquo;s lens makes me feel so good. I feel I&rsquo;m more engaged in the society and economy.</p>
<p>Post: 1 year into stock market, TBD</p>
<h3 id="english-reading-speaking-writing">English (Reading, speaking, writing)</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m an old hand learning English, I&rsquo;m fully convinced that vocabulary is my primary roadblock for blending into American society and my career advancement. I read/memorize those words every morning, night, weekend or whenever I got some free time.<br>
Almost a decade ago I found Eudic, I have been a happy customer ever since. This year I found Anki, it&rsquo;s pretty awesome and it&rsquo;s got huge extensibility and vibrant community, I&rsquo;m sparing some of job from Eudic to Anki.</p>
<p>Post: Repeating 20 times for every new word, TBD</p>
<h2 id="health-">Health ‚úÖ</h2>
<h3 id="neck-issue">Neck issue</h3>
<p>My neck pain still bothers me every now and then, whenever I got stressed out on desk, I&rsquo;d fall into bad posture and be paralyzed the next day. Hope I could get over it.</p>
<p>Post: How I conquer my stiff neck problem, TBD</p>
<h3 id="workout">workout</h3>
<p>I do home workout most of time these days, mainly push up and pull resistance bands, I use Reventure balance board to do indoor balance practice when I can not go out stating.</p>
<p>I found this thing called &ldquo;Contrast shower&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s very interesting, it&rsquo;s so easy, fun and fulfilling. I feel so much energetic/refreshed coming out of shower room every time, I&rsquo;m glad I find another practice I can do in my lifetime.</p>

<p>I finally started dating after being single for years, it&rsquo;s still weird to me spending too much time with somebody but my computer.</p>

<!-- ## Regret ‚ùå -->
<!-- ###  Early up --> 
<!-- The first line of most my daily journals are usually I overslept this morning, I start my day with self-resentment almost every day, that's so bad. I know if I could get up early, my day would be way more organized and productive, and I've been struggling with it for more than a decade, I still haven't given up. I will conquer it, I will set it as my primary goal for 2022. -->  
<!-- ### Outputting --> 
<!-- I'm tired of being a consumer and being invisible, I'd really want to have some social influences. The idea has haunted for a few years since I was getting 30, now I really need to get it started, and I'd like to start with good old fashioned way, blogging! -->
