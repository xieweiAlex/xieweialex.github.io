<p>Age has been just a number for me since I known things. Because it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, it doesn&rsquo;t bring or guarantee anything, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m better, smarter or wiser than you because I&rsquo;m older, then why do we care? I treat it a general guidance, I know its existence, I respect it, but I don&rsquo;t serious follow it. Until I passed the 30 years old threshold few months ago, I distinctly feel things became different. Someone constantly whisper around my ears something like &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not young any more&rdquo;, &ldquo;your youth has passed&rdquo;. I started feeling pressure to do something serious for myself the whole lifetime, otherwise I gonna be nobody and invisible as my 20s. Tho I still haven&rsquo;t found what cause I could devote myself into, but I do notice lots of my ides or way of thinking has significant different with when I was young.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="time-is-limited-im-more-calm-at-most-of-things">Time is limited, I&rsquo;m more calm at most of things</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m more patient on things I think worth doing. My belief has been constantly enriched since I left college, like freedom of speech, free market, digital resolution, individualism etc, my knowledge about my belief has been consolidated. I know what I&rsquo;m doing, I know how the society is doing (roughly) and how it suppose to operate, knowing this give me so much confidence and assurance to do things I think it&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m calm, determined and relaxed, just do the right thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more impatient on things I don&rsquo;t think worth my attention. I started saying No a lot and I&rsquo;m not sorry or unsettle about it, because I know what&rsquo;s right for myself or the society overall. I became bold as I expected and wished, I&rsquo;m happy about it. I did ignore lots of things or hurt/ruffle someone which I don&rsquo;t really care, time is limited, and I&rsquo;m worth being friend, people can&rsquo;t appreciate my boldness and sincerity just let them get out of my way.</p>
<h3 id="leadership">leadership</h3>
<p>I constantly feel I&rsquo;d like to be leader, because as an individual contributor the things I can do is so limited, since my time is limited, I can&rsquo;t way that long. I&rsquo;d like to leverage my knowledge/influence, take more responsibility, make things happen in a larger scale.</p>
<h3 id="give-back">Give back</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a sucker a really long time and I&rsquo;m shame of it. I&rsquo;ve always absorbing from the society, people around me, I think it&rsquo;s high time to give back.</p>
<p>As for the society, I&rsquo;d like to make something good/nice/cool. I strongly touched the phrase Steve Jobs demoed in the presentation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people show their appreciation to the society by producing some product which is beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hope I could find a hell to die on, I&rsquo;d like to burn myself in it, embody myself into the product, my knowledge, my values, my appreciation to the world.</p>
<p>As for people around me, I&rsquo;d like to be an influencer, I&rsquo;d like to be a mentor if I could.</p>
<h3 id="settle-down">settle down</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been moving around a handful of industries and cities since I left college which was full of random and lacked of direction, I&rsquo;ve been constantly saying goodbye for a lot of things, I thought I was cool and strong (not tied by anything), now I feel a little bit sad about it. I&rsquo;m starting become old, things overdue need to be addressed. There is an old saying Chinese which I started feeling so wise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>有恒产者有恒心 which translate to English is &ldquo;Who has stabled investment would have constant determination&rdquo;
shall have his peace of mind when he possesses a piece of land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m little bit tired of wandering life. I&rsquo;d like to find a place I could settle down, build a solid friend circle which could last long.</p>
