        "body": "It\u0026rsquo;s hard I didn\u0026rsquo;t know playing skateboard is that hard until I tried to learn it seriously. I spent couple of months during COVID learning Ollie alone, and I still haven\u0026rsquo;t master it. Ollie is just a starting trick for skateboarding, I got a long way to go. I was very confidence to start since I played roller blade for years which should give me a good balance, which should make my jumpstart easier, I underestimated it.\nThere are countless tricks for skateboarding, I can see myself playing it next 5 years and still get a long way to go, I won\u0026rsquo;t feel bored, to say the least, this makes excited.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m getting old, when I try to do something seriously, I hope to do it in a long term, I can take my time, enjoy the journey and accompany.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s dangerous \u0026amp; inspiring One part I like skateboarding because it\u0026rsquo;s kinda dangerous, you can get your body scratched, your ankle, legs broken for a bad luck, easier. It\u0026rsquo;s not for a faint of heart. There are numerous skateboard tricks circulating in internet, which are too bold, some people might despise their boldness, some might get aspired, I\u0026rsquo;m the latter. I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself can master those tricks anytime soon, but even just imaging one day I could do that already makes me excited.\nThe stereotype of people playing skateboard usually are cantankerous, tameless, they often fuel my energy and makes me excited.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s convenient I loved playing basketball when I was a teenage, it\u0026rsquo;s convenient, sophisticated and fun. But after I stopped growing height, and being moderately short in height is in such a disadvantage position in the basketball court, I\u0026rsquo;m very unhappy about it. I know that\u0026rsquo;s not anybody\u0026rsquo;s fault, I just opted out.\nRecently there is a fad that lots of people fascinating into skiing or snowboarding, I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked those balance required sport, especially snowboarding, it looks cool and I can play some tricks with it. I went to play a couple of times, and I found out it\u0026rsquo;s not very good for me to take it seriously.\nIn most of area you can only play snowboard couple of months in a year, all base on the lenient of weather. Usually you have to drive couple of hours to the snow field, since it is not convenient to get there, people usually play many hours non stop from mountain top to bottom, I usually get bored playing 1 or 2 hours.\nTo me, playing snowboarding is more like a social sport, a group of people hitting there and play together is a typical theme. As I\u0026rsquo;m not a social person(I\u0026rsquo;m not anti-social in any means), one of the reason I loved basketball is I can play myself all alone and enjoy it, which you just can\u0026rsquo;t do it in football, pingpong or tennis. I would expect the sports (or anything) I like, I spent most of time I\u0026rsquo;m progressing myself alone, and some occasional chances we hit up some friends sparking ideas together.\nOne thing I like about skateboard is it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require anything besides a board and willing. You can play in most of place you want, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much cost or maintenance(I\u0026rsquo;ve been tormenting my board for over a year, the maintenance is $0).\n"

        "date" : "2020.11.25",
        "body": "How it started I got an internet call(anonymous call) at 11 am, I hesitated a few seconds to take because most of those calls are scams, but I took it. It was a female voice saying she is a police officer and my motorcycle is found and it\u0026rsquo;s in Fremont, she wanted me to stop by ASAP. I was like, What??!! 😮😮 I got ecstatic immediately, my bike has gone over 2 weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve already crossed off my shopping list for my bike. I said I will be there very soon. I grabbed my helmet and gloves and thinking I might be better riding in local instead of freeway in case it isn\u0026rsquo;t in a really good shape, as always, I got too optimistic. 🙂\nOn spot After I arrived the industrial area in Fremont, I got a feeling of gang fighting scene in the movie. Deserted factories, ragged road, heavy-duty trucks buzzing around etc. I approached the police car, officer Santana asked me to sign some paper work, I asked \u0026ldquo;Where is my bike?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;there it is\u0026rdquo;, she pointed me to a RV. My bike was bonded with an RV with lots bruises on the body. Then I saw the engine lock with ignition has been cut off, windshield and mirror on the left are gone. I definitely CAN NOT ride it home. 😩\nI started contacting my insurance agent for help, to my surprise, she was cranky(even cruel in my opinion). She responded \u0026ldquo;What do you want me to do for you? You\u0026rsquo;re not my customer anymore, I\u0026rsquo;m crossing off your name in my customer list\u0026rdquo;, I was like, ❓❓❓ 😮 that\u0026rsquo;s unexpected!\nI was very inexperienced and helpless and being stranded on the road, I know my insurance has been expired (it expired two weeks ago before the bike got stolen which is another bummer), she has all the right not to help me, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand why she chose to burn the bridge, she can just say anything top of her mind could help me a little bit but disguise her indifference, she even didn\u0026rsquo;t give an excuse, and just hung up, twice!! I was shocked. That\u0026rsquo;s very unprofessional and it\u0026rsquo;s unacceptable! I will try to use my influence (if I have or will have) to talk people away from her service from now on. That sucks! 😡\nThen I moved on trying to contact my friend for help, Officer Santana cruised back and told me that she wants me to get the bike out of the scene as soon as possible, she can\u0026rsquo;t leave without knowing my bike is out there. Because the person being arrested will be released today and he might come back anytime, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want me getting into conflict on spot. I was like WTH 😮! Though it\u0026rsquo;s my bike but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to fight a \u0026ldquo;criminal\u0026rdquo; who thought he got my bike. I also felt warm that she came back to inform me, she cared about me, even she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know me at all, comparing with Joana, Officer Santana is so kind. After a few seconds thought, I decided to manual roll the bike to a safer place, I rolled it into a building few blocks away.\nTowing options The next thing is towing it back(it\u0026rsquo;s not operational any more, the ignition has been cut off), I realized I should not tow it back home since it requires immediate repair. I contacted a motorcycle transport service from RMC Moto recommendation, the guy replied me that he just had a motorcycle accident which needs to stay in bed for 1-2 weeks. What? 😮 I suddenly feel so grateful that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any motorcycle accident, bike being stolen away isn\u0026rsquo;t the worse thing can happen. Then I contacted another motorbike mover, he asked for $125, I agreed. If my insurance is still valid, I could\u0026rsquo;ve saved the money and phone querying.\nMy phone somehow got wonky the whole day, threw lots wrench in my works, e.g. I can not turn on camera taking photo, can not load map while using Google/Apple map. After hours of frustration I realized that I just upgraded an iOS Beta version last night, it was a mistake. I was so hopeless while my phone stopped working, my phone is my everything while I\u0026rsquo;m outside.\nRepair options I pulled my bike to RMC moto, the mechanic gave me the estimate around $1400, my heart sunk. I hoped it could below $1000, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid to spend too much on the bike but I still like it, I like to ride, I guess I will go with that.\nConclusion Today is Thanksgiving, one of the most important holiday in America, I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful that I got my bike back. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a sloppy person, I\u0026rsquo;ve lost a handful precious personal stuff in the past. Every time bad luck happens, I whisper to myself \u0026ldquo;Come on, give me a second chance, I will be more careful\u0026rdquo;. This is the first time I\u0026rsquo;m given the second chance, Even though I might need to spend thousands of bucks to repair it, the second chance wasn\u0026rsquo;t given for free, I\u0026rsquo;m fine with that.\nThe stocks I own soared both yesterday and today, I made $4400 (unrealized) just today which is the best day since I started investing in stock market, specially the S\u0026amp;P 500 dropped around 0.5%, I feel cool and grateful. I got some money for my harmed bike. And I went out almost a whole day (11 am to 5 pm) I almost didn\u0026rsquo;t do any work today, but nobody complaints about my absence, I even didn\u0026rsquo;t need to ask permission to leave, I don\u0026rsquo;t take the permissiveness for granted, I thank my teammates/manager and my company. 😇 😘\n"

        "body": "I often got asked about \u0026ldquo;tell me about yourself\u0026rdquo; situation, I got awkward and don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start, so I was thinking why don\u0026rsquo;t I just have a dedicated page to tell a bit about myself, of course it gonna be biased, as my view conflicts my own interest 😃.\nAs I like tags a lot, I\u0026rsquo;d like to have some tags for myself as well. This page is still WIP, I might expand or cut off the tags over time. slow-poke idealist curiosity enterprising high self-esteem emotional-stable stoic growth mindset non-competitive sapiosexual\nAnimal Person I love animals without a doubt, I follow cute animal public accounts in any social media whatever I use, like Instagram, Twitter, FB or Wechat. I feel genuinely happy when I see cute animals, \u0026ldquo;Thedodo\u0026rdquo; is one of my favorite public account. I like both cats 🐱 and dogs 🐶. Though I feel cat is more cute in general(I spent more time on cat photos and videos), but I like dog the most, I admire and appreciate those natural traits from dogs, like loyalty, braveness and optimism. One of my ideal house would be having a small farm in backyard, I can grow some vegetables along with some animals.\nSports Looking back my grow up history, I liked a handful of sports. Doing exercise makes me excited and happy in general, and I always get friends while doing sport. I spent a big amount of teenage time playing basketball, I loved it. I played roller skating for years, then years of roller blading in college. I met my first girlfriend while playing roller skate in college. After college, I started like jogging regularly, most of time after sunset while listening podcast. Recently started late 2019, I started doing weight lifting(or muscle building), skateboarding and motorcycling (I consider riding motorcycle is a sport 😺)\nAmbivert I\u0026rsquo;m not an introvert person for sure, I can and willing to express my feeling and affection anytime needed. I talk a lot when with people or topic I\u0026rsquo;m interested in, I believe communication is the key 🔑 for lots of problems. I like to exert my influence/endeavor to make things becoming better. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have many friends social life, I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of gathering or party, social events drain my energy significantly. I rarely contact any of my friends which I know I should do more.\nOpen-minded I\u0026rsquo;m very open-minded and adaptive, I\u0026rsquo;m a typical progressive liberal in America\u0026rsquo;s political spectrum, I\u0026rsquo;m open to a lots of novel ideas, I often got mind blown by those different ideas, and I enjoy exploring them. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of lots of traditions no matter what culture it belongs or how long it has been adherent.\nOptimist I\u0026rsquo;m a natural optimist, I tend to believe things are promising in our life, all the time. I tend to look for changes, make some changes, either physically or mentally, consciously or unconsciously, I believe changes bring to good, making progress with mistakes better than leaving regrets, etc.\nRationalism I\u0026rsquo;ve got a rational personality. I like doing analysis and predictions. I believe our life progress bases on the decisions we make every day, whether big or small. I tend to analysis the world/society around me, I only believe things can be scientific tested. Those zodiac, religion are not my thing.\nAdventurist I enjoy the feeling of risk-taking, it makes me being alive. I enjoy the adrenalin spike while riding motorcycle in open freeway(of course I wear protective gear every time). I enjoy any of those extreme sports, specially those sports require split-second decision making which spikes the adrenalin release. I do those sports to make myself both mentally and physically strong, and I feel happy when I\u0026rsquo;m feeling strong ✊.\n"

        "body": "As a lifetime learner turned 30, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot during the self-exploratory journey. I\u0026rsquo;ve found some principles work for me very well, I\u0026rsquo;d like to write them down publicly, let the sunlight be the disinfectant.\nEmbrace English I can\u0026rsquo;t emphasize enough the importance of English since I live in a country where English is the official language, and I work in an industry where English is the dominant language. General English skills (read, speak, write) could become a bottleneck for the foreseeable years to come. (That takes time, I know that, but I hope I can shorten the path.)\nI\u0026rsquo;m almost learning English while doing anything, I have an E-note with me which has the highest precedence for my E-notes. I note English quotes, words, and slang every day I encounter\u0026ndash;from a casual conversation, an official/random email, news media, watching a movie / TV show, or just purposefully reciting English words in the same sentence repo, and 2020 is the 4th year since I started doing it, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of myself.\nEmbrace digitalization I truly believe everything that can be digitalized will be digitalized, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of time and we\u0026rsquo;re just getting started, I\u0026rsquo;m so excited about standing on the edge of the curve, there is so much potential and opportunities ahead. And I\u0026rsquo;m also very grateful that I stumbled into this field accidentally, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been benefiting a lot, and I will try to get more and give back more if I can. 😃\nSunlight is the best disinfectant  Anything worth doing worthy doing publicly.\n I believe transparency is the solution for a lot of things I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, and as long as they\u0026rsquo;re transparent, we can hold them accountable, I\u0026rsquo;m more open to it.\nOpen source is taking over the software development.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not into bombshells. Burying yourself into a big, grandiose goal and hoping it someday and astonish the world, that\u0026rsquo;s not my style. Just like the agile philosophy in software programming, I\u0026rsquo;d like to just crank it out a prototype and try a quick iteration. The most important thing is that we\u0026rsquo;re in the right direction, we can adjust minor details along the journey.\nUse tools to make life easier Of course ideas and theories have large impact and longer influence, most of tools just like materialized objects from ideas. I know that, but I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to frequently learn new ideas, but I still want to make my life easier in an easy way. At the end of the day, knowing to use tool is one of the biggest differentiation keeping us from animals. I\u0026rsquo;d like to have all kinds of tools to facilitate my ways of thinking, reading and adapting new habits.\nOne of my favorite tool is Vim, I\u0026rsquo;ve used it for years, I\u0026rsquo;m still learning it on a daily basis, I almost use it all the time once in front of computer. I almost only editing/writing everything in the Vim environment. This kind of tool has implemented many philosophies and values, learning from a practical tangible tool about those ideas is just more fun. 😃\nScaling, Scaling, Scaling I\u0026rsquo;ve become old enough to not care much about many frivolous things and some nonsense traditions. Life is short, but it can be long enough if we focus, and I always wanted to learn things I could use it for decades, ideas I could apply to everywhere. My current life path is pretty linear, I\u0026rsquo;m waiting patiently and doing all the preparations I can imagine until one day my impact could take off 😼.\nBe happy and be nice Having a happy balanced lifestyle is crucial in the long run. I\u0026rsquo;m a naturally happy person, I\u0026rsquo;m living in life works for me. The key to my happiness is I always analysis, I heard that there is an old saying \u0026ldquo;suffering is the gap between current situation and expectations\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m total with it. Striving to improve my current status, recognizing, raising, or lowering my expectations, I adjust them in a relatively agile way by self-reflection on a daily basis.\nI\u0026rsquo;m genuinely happy when things make sense for me, even when they don\u0026rsquo;t side with me. Society has been generous to rational people like me, I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful about that, not everybody has the natural habit or pure luck that I do, I recognize it, to be nice to people I don\u0026rsquo;t really agree as a gratitude to the society is the way I\u0026rsquo;m practicing. 😇\n"

        "body": "I\u0026rsquo;ve always been fascinated by good tools, let me just record those tools have amazed me and I regret I didn\u0026rsquo;t try them earlier.\nFootrest \u0026amp; toning ball for my stiff neck I\u0026rsquo;ve been suffered from neck stiffness for years, I know it\u0026rsquo;s because my sedentary lifestyle and work style, I can\u0026rsquo;t change them in a short time. I did notice whenever I sit in front of my desk, my hands put on the surface of desk, the pressure either goes to my shoulder or I lay down more it goes to my lower back, no other way around. Until I found the footrest, it only takes $10+ bucks, I can vivid aware some of my upper body pressure goes to my foot which is awesome.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found stretching my body every once in a while during the day is a good habit to relax my body, specially for my wonky stiff neck. All of sudden I notice the toning ball in grocery outlet only cost $5 bucks, I started using it as an accompany during stretch since then. The ball is so comfort and versatile, I like it. 😸\nTrue color for Terminal Vim I\u0026rsquo;ve always been bothered by the anemic UI support in terminal vim. It\u0026rsquo;s just so bland and primitive, before that I thought I don\u0026rsquo;t care about UI at all, it taught me I do care in a basic level. I turned to MacVim for years for the basic UI support. Now things will turn around, the terminal vim has better color and contrast then the MacVim, it might be a game changer, I might turn back to terminal vim and work with Tmux multiple windows and sessions for all my writing tasks.\nVim smoothie plugin This plugin is recommend from email subscription of \u0026ldquo;Mastering Vim quickly\u0026rdquo;, at beginning I was suspicious of this unpopular plugin which just has just 100+ stars in Github then. I gave it a try, it struck me for the first few minutes❗.\nI never thought the scrolling in Vim should be smooth, but why not 😄? The user experience is so good, I can\u0026rsquo;t understand how I could I tolerate the bouncing jump, I can never go back.\nGoogle photos I went to Google photos just for the unlimited photo uploading for free (with some photo quality losing which is acceptable for me). As a person not that sensitive to privacy, I like Google a lot. I can lost or break my phone anytime, the most valuable assets are the photos/videos in my phone, it\u0026rsquo;s better have a cloud backup, automatically, painlessly. That\u0026rsquo;s a big mentally relief.\nThe feature abundance of Google photos really amazed me, I like it!\nTig \u0026amp; Git rebase interactive from Git I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved Git, I admire the stability, versatility and powerfulness from Git so much (Tho I started thinking Git does have bug as well, it struck me again since Git as an open source software we use all the time, but we almost assume it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have bugs).\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m kind of getting sick of the inconsecutive sequential commands in Git, the most notorious is the git stash, it\u0026rsquo;s just so inconvenient to check them up or clean them, lots of time we end up with tons of stash list we even can\u0026rsquo;t tell what are those shit inside, and we had to drop them all in batch which is awful practice. Another one like showing the content in the commit one by one is just drudgery work in terminal.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always loved those commands have the simplicity and easy to pipe ability in terminal, I thought I don\u0026rsquo;t care about UX much, Tig changed my idea, I do care. Tig provide the nice interactive terminal UI interface, I can make lots commands in consecutive, that\u0026rsquo;s awesome!\nAnother one is git rebase interactive, I\u0026rsquo;ve been amazed by how powerful and well-thought out about this subcommand. It might worth taking another post to illustrate, it gives me the ability and granular control of change history, like dancing in my repo, it\u0026rsquo;s so much fun.\n"

        "body": "All of a sudden everybody on WeChat started sharing their life moment of the same day 4 years ago, then I realized today is the leap day for every 4 years. I started thinking what\u0026rsquo;s my life like 4 years ago, skimming my social media(mainly Wechat), and got some memory splinters.\nI lost my luggage in Yueyang I was in Shenzhen, just a few weeks back from my hometown Yueyang where I lost my luggage in a cab. I was very disappointed 😩, I never thought someone would seriously take my luggage and don\u0026rsquo;t return back. I even didn\u0026rsquo;t lock it (I still don\u0026rsquo;t have the habit of locking luggage). I didn\u0026rsquo;t take the receipt from driver. I made numerous calls to the taxi coordination center, broadcasted the bounty from 200 RMB to 4000 RMB. I knew there are so many security cameras on the road on traffic lights, I knew the very precise time I passed those traffic lights, so as long as we can access the security camera footage we should be able to find the taxi and get some information. That was the first time in my lifetime seeking help from the local government, and I was super upset about all the local government branches' sluggishness and irresponsibility. I ended up visiting 7 or 8 branches in my small town and none of them gave a damn of my lost, those people were so arrogant and unprofessional as shit. I always knew how corrupt and irresponsible the local government department is, and that time I was crushed.\nIn a hindsight, if I booked a Didi or Uber that night which was surging at that time, it would be a different story since I could\u0026rsquo;ve all the taxi info in my phone. As a self-professed tech enthusiast who always embracing technology and the digital revolution, I made bad choice at that time.\nWorking life As my work, I was very happy working in Jpush at that time, a new manager came to our team 1 month ago and we got along very well. I was living/working with a few bachelor colleagues 24/7. We were always staying very late in office because we got nowhere to go besides the office, that was a simple happy bachelor period. Before long, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect things could change so dramatically, I had to leave JPush abruptly and unwillingly. I had a good time there, I made many friends there (Though most of them we\u0026rsquo;re not in track any more). Communication and the ability to speak out inside group is always a key issue for a good relationship, I learned it a hard way. If anyone thinks I\u0026rsquo;m good at communication, I started learning from that. 😼\nPreparing study abroad In the meantime, I was preparing for studying abroad in the US. I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to get outside of China to checkout the world. I failed the application 1 year ago, it was the second time trying and I had no clue what would happen. I vividly remember the recruiting staff from the school I\u0026rsquo;ll be in gave me a call and started the conversation with “How are you doing today?\u0026quot;, I got lost at that very moment, all I knew for the conversation starter was when people say “How are you”, you can response “I\u0026rsquo;m fine, thank you!\u0026quot;. I spent a few minutes stuttering out some phrases about what I did that day 😅.\nMy English was so bad, that was a hard time, I\u0026rsquo;m very glad I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through this far. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe coming to the US and lived here since then was the first time I went out of China (Besides Taiwan actually, ¯_(ツ)_/¯, Taiwan is special). There was no accident, no surprise for my visiting, I had no relative and no friend living in the US (I did have one in the school which is AJie), it has been 4 years since then. Coming to the US is one of the best choice I deliberately made myself in my lifetime, I\u0026rsquo;m very proud of that.\nBitcoin As Bitcoin, right before I decided to come to the US, I sold all my holdings for Bitcoin/Litecoin. At that time, Bitcoin has been staying low and sideway prices around $500 - $700 for 3 years. I had enough patience at that time since I was about to start a new journey. I choice to reduce my uncertainties even though I was never short on money. I lost more than half of my invest in Bitcoin, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect that Bitcoin soared 10+ times just 1 year later. Ironically, now the Bitcoin price is around 20 times comparing then, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna jump on it again. Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna put all my stakes on it, but since the production halving is about to happen in 2 months and the global stock market is stumbling, I don\u0026rsquo;t see any other good alternative investment choice to go.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all I can recall for this date 4 years ago after reviewing my Wechat Moment for almost 1 hour, I hope that I could have some more pleasant memories next time around. Stay tuned. ✊\n"

But since I left my hometown and living alone in few metro cities for years, I found myself became more self-center, independent, and most importantly, happier. I know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, I know what I want and I\u0026rsquo;m doing my own best in the present, I tend to take rejection more relax, I only worry about letting myself down and lose my hope.\nI tried really hard to find my own passion and proudness. I want to be happy and proud, relax and determined, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard since most of my friends who are Chinese, my family members are still live in collective society, most of personal experience were there as well. I believe the individualism, I\u0026rsquo;d like to record some excerpts to remind myself every once in a while.\nThe Source of Truth  The first problem with feedback is that humans are unreliable raters of other humans. Over the past 40 years psychometricians have shown in study after study that people don’t have the objectivity to hold in their heads a stable definition of an abstract quality, such as business acumen or assertiveness, and then accurately evaluate someone else on it. Our evaluations are deeply colored by our own understanding of what we’re rating others on, our own sense of what good looks like for a particular competency, our harshness or leniency as raters, and our own inherent and unconscious biases\n  Just as your doctor doesn’t know the truth of your pain, we don’t know the truth about our colleagues, at least not in any objective way\n It\u0026rsquo;s very hard to feel someone else\u0026rsquo;s feeling, especially when you don\u0026rsquo;t know them or their personal history very well. The same as \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t judge\u0026rdquo;, because it\u0026rsquo;s just hard to tell.\n And the third belief is that great performance is universal, analyzable, and describable, and that once defined, it can be transferred from one person to another, regardless of who each individual is.\n  Focusing people on their shortcomings doesn\u0026rsquo;t enable learning; it impairs it. This is the “fight or flight” system, which mutes the other parts of the brain and allows us to focus only on the information most necessary to survive. Your brain responds to critical feedback as a threat and narrows its activity\n Sometimes I got this bad habit, I feel it\u0026rsquo;s my obligation as a friend (family member) to point out their drawbacks, it\u0026rsquo;s helping them. I\u0026rsquo;ve got lots of pushback, and I got confused or hurt lots of times. I should have more patients, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hurt others just because I want to help.\n We’re often told that the key to learning is to get out of our comfort zones, but these findings contradict that particular chestnut: Take us very far out of our comfort zones, and our brains stop paying attention to anything other than surviving the experience. It’s clear that we learn most in our comfort zones, because that’s where our neural pathways are most concentrated. It’s where we’re most open to possibility, most creative, insightful, and productive\n This part shocked me, it\u0026rsquo;s so true. Looking back my own history, I did feel very excited about stepping out my comfort zone and gaining new experience/skills, but it was only true when I knew what I was doing, I knew what was wanting. It would be a huge pain dragging or pushing by others out of my own comfort zone, maybe few times I made it, I do appreciate those \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo;, but I\u0026rsquo;m very sure lots of times those \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo; are just in vain and introduced struggle.\nExcellence  Excellence is idiosyncratic\nExcellence is also not the opposite of failure. If you study failure, you’ll learn a lot about failure but nothing about how to achieve excellence. Excellence has its own pattern.\n How to Help myself Excel Everyone\u0026rsquo;s current status is the summation of his personal experience and family(raised situation) background or other random facts.\nrandom Instead of asking and listening from others, why don\u0026rsquo;t we dedicate some time (customize a habit would be the best) to listen from ourselves, of course, you can get self bias\n"

Specially things like culture, religion or belief etc, those topics are too big for us as nonprofessional to talk about. But as daily trial random things, well, some of them could also be bound with years of life experience.\nBut my point is we try to be as objective as we can, put our ego aside. I hate to discuss about anything with people who think their thoughts are absolutely right, anybody challenge their way of thinking is challenging themselves. Yeah, sounds weird, but lots of people do this way, even including myself sometimes. I think that\u0026rsquo;s fine for something, like belief etc, those things are just so ingrained, they\u0026rsquo;re so hard to pull out of ourselves, actually they\u0026rsquo;ve become part of ourselves. I believe we should be proud, happy or at least accept those things ingrained to ourselves, they\u0026rsquo;re part of ourselves. But lots of things are not, like people you like, political views you believe, they probably just gonna stay with you for days or years let\u0026rsquo;s say.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell sometimes, because everything I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced, I believe, I like or hate made myself. But the rule of thumb is don\u0026rsquo;t let ego become obstacle of your thinking. I like the idea from Ray Dalio, to stay \u0026ldquo;radical open\u0026rdquo;, everything I believe are absolutely right could be wrong in some case.\nEasy to lose their temper I hate to discuss with people about something then all of sudden he lost his temper, I guess most of people feel the same. I always wonder why all of sudden those people lost their temper, I think either they\u0026rsquo;re not used to be challenged or they become desperate when they can\u0026rsquo;t convince the counterpart or they found they\u0026rsquo;ve wasted too much time on the topics don\u0026rsquo;t matter, these are the scenarios I could image or understand, there are could tons of reasons various by person which I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. Sometimes I also lost my temper because people behavior total out of my expectation, so I need to learn to get myself mentally prepared.\nAt the end of day, I\u0026rsquo;m also a human, even though I\u0026rsquo;m super rational, I could be ruffled by confusing or surprising sometimes. I try not to, I try to understand people, as long as I understand those behavior, I got my mentally prepared, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to forcefully sell my ideas, I won\u0026rsquo;t get myself in desperate, I should be fine. At the end of day, I\u0026rsquo;m not suppose to change anybody\u0026rsquo;s idea, talk or interact with others all just for myself improving and having fun, I want to be relax and enjoy along the way.\nBut I can\u0026rsquo;t change people\u0026rsquo;s way of doing things, and some people\u0026rsquo;s radical behavior could obviously affect my mood, in one party, I should try to learn and understand those people or behavior, in other hand, I should learn to let it go, there are so many things or people in the world I could never understand, I\u0026rsquo;m not a god, just let it go and leave my normal happy life.\n"

I think most probably I grew in a traditional confucian culture, it emphasis stabilization of family as the smallest unit of society is the essence of a good society, and female usually act as a assistant in the family which male adult is the leader. I\u0026rsquo;m very used to it. I do admire the strong ego of modern women, but maybe just because my ego is relative weak, I just feel I\u0026rsquo;m not able to work with that out.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just a traditional Asian adult who hopes I could be the cornerstone of the family(Yeah, in Asian culture, getting married and have children is a must, not an option), my partner would be better admire me, assist me.\nMen usually acts as hard-edged character, but female act malleable other side. I really like girls have the malleable personality.\nSweet smile \u0026amp; love life The same as majority male adult, I like girls have sweet smile and act sweet all the time if possible.\nI like girls who can make life delicate and exquisite. I like those people who try to improve life quality all the time, understand the unspoken rules of life, get along with it that attracts me.\nEmpathy I like girls who have strong empathy, she can understand the subtle feelings, she will be touched easily and comfort others when necessary.\nAfter I wrote this down, I feel my expectations are typically old fashion Asian male way, which is a shame I always profess myself as a progress liberal.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny I myself know myself in the bottom of my heart I naturally have those characters, in many years, I feel like my personality is like a girl, I\u0026rsquo;d definitely willing the date a girl has a copy of my personality. But over the years striving in the society, I got over it, I changed quit a bit on the surface.\nWhat are those characters put me off? Being aggressive Working or living with girls with aggressive personality really put me off, I had few experience, I got lost. But with male on the same situation, I don\u0026rsquo;t that mind, I enjoyed challenge authority and being challenged by others as well, I know this sounds sexism, but it\u0026rsquo;s just another old fashion Asian way.\nanti-intellectual "

I guess lots of people are kind of sick of the non-stop notifications coming every few minutes even seconds (Specially some notifications are default to alert instead of preview, it would hover there forever which is super annoying, that\u0026rsquo;s a another story),\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, the notifications are very necessary, we want keep ourselves informed. I knew there is a notification center centralize all notifications, we can check them any time. There is a \u0026ldquo;no disturb\u0026rdquo; toggle we can turn on, so there is no notification popping out any more, they all end up collecting in notification center anyway which is nice. But my notification center always end up thousands of feeds which I never checked regularly, it keeps overrun all the time, I never really read any of them, just blindly delete all.\nWhy it ends like this? I only found it out when I explored the shortcut of \u0026ldquo;no disturb mode\u0026rdquo;, just Press and hold the Option key while you click the Notification Center icon in the menu bar, that\u0026rsquo;s fantastic easy. Then I realize how the redundant steps stopped me from clicking the toggle, click the menu icon and wait the animation of notification swiping out, then move to the toggle and click and swept it out, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look very complicate, but it do require some context change, some move around, the animation I\u0026rsquo;d say even worse the experience tho it only takes less than 1 second.\nThen I started using the notification center because opt in the no disturb mode which makes me not able to receive any pop up notification. I had to check the center to know what\u0026rsquo;s going on, after I checked, I would clean them conveniently. The problem solved and the new habit customized.\n everything has its inertia\n It reminds why we need a Killer feature to migrate habit, because the migration expense is big, but the ground work is needed to\n"

I think that\u0026rsquo;s just a side effect of free of expression. Spreading disinformation as individuals is free of punishment, because you can\u0026rsquo;t tell before it has been verify (lots of times), people tend to believe what they already believed, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of self self-reinforce cycle.\nThe world is complicate, there isn\u0026rsquo;t black-and-white truth most of time, everybody sees the side of the truth, the press tend to give side of truth because people like to watch what they\u0026rsquo;ve believed, if media takes no stands, no conclusion, very objective and unbiased, that would be very boring and not informative.\nFree of fear I\u0026rsquo;ve watched numerous times of this video free video, people can only be free when the government is constrained. Theoretically we can do anything we can as long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t violate the law, we need to learn the rules (laws), the law should not change frequently, the law should make sense. We can sue the government anytime if we don\u0026rsquo;t agree. Protect the vulnerable is part of humanitarian but also for ourselves, because any of us can get into the dark side. We protect them is also protect ourselves (Is that part of empathy?).\nFree of meaningless traditions interesting video here as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVAhr4hZDJE\nI only started know the \u0026ldquo;Procedural justice\u0026rdquo; til I arrived in the US. there are so many example of it, if the police doesn\u0026rsquo;t have decent evident of I did things wrong, they can\u0026rsquo;t interrogate me or ask anything from me, I have the right not to fear about that as long as I do things decently. There is no such thing in China I would say.\nLots of people live in US they don\u0026rsquo;t trust the government, neither the press. They trust their own judgement, they protect their own rights to bear guns.\nThe Amish life I was astonished there are more than 200K+ Amish people living in the US, they don\u0026rsquo;t believe any modern techniques, most of them don\u0026rsquo;t speak English, they live the medieval lifestyle.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t understand that choice, as I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the vegetarian lifestyle if not for environment purpose. But people has the right to live whatever kind of lifestyle they want, happy is subjective, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to harmony with the modern society.\nFreedom of religion  Fa lun gong  "

        "body": "Don\u0026rsquo;t get strapped by rules Recently just few months ago I started riding motorcycle, I knew it was pretty scary riding bike in this grueling Bay Area, but I knew I gonna love it, it was so much fun hitting on the road in a fast speed without a iron wrapper enclosed, I can feel the wind and road. As a beginner, I need to practice a lot to get use to ride on the two wheels, and the best and most difficult motorcycle practicing place is mountain road, luckily, there is a curvy mountain road close to my house. I went there practicing cornering a lot, there was a problem bothered me so much, there were few times I felt I almost lost control of my bike. Because whenever there is a big turn, or complicate road condition, the speed limit would change, specially in the mountain road, the speed limit change a lot. As a newbie rider, it nerves me a lot to adjust my speed base on the guidepost. Some day all of sudden, I realized I should let me self be the judge of my safety and comfort. There are so many factors affect the safety speed, like visibility, humidity, pavement condition, wind power and direction, gradient, and my general body status etc. I could start it slow, but I should get the ability to blend all those factors I could aware and let myself know is my current speed comfort or not.\nThe most scary moment is to making a big turn in a mountain road, because in order to make a turn for motorcycle, you have to push the handle bar in the same direction you are turning to in order to make yourself lean to direction you want and make the bike go that way, the technical term is counter steering. It\u0026rsquo;s counter-intuitive and hard.\nI was so nervous and uncomfortable about it, besides the leaning during the turn, I had to constant check my current speed and the road limit speed on the guidepost. Then someday all of a sudden I realized I should not check the speed, I should let me main focus on the road, there are so many factors affect my safety speed, like the road visibility, the wind speed, the humidity, my pavement condition and my body condition etc. After I\u0026rsquo;ve practiced tons of miles, myself on the road should be center judge for what\u0026rsquo;s the safe and comfort speed for me, I should have a general feeling of what\u0026rsquo;s safe for myself. Since then, I felt much more fun and comfort on the road, all my focus on the road, I gather all the road condition naturally through my body sensor and tell myself how is it, I might ease off during the turn or speed up, or consistent changing as I felt good, I got instant response of trial base on the my true feeling, I might hit on the same turn everyday in different speed, you know what, I never check and I don\u0026rsquo;t care. Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m not a crazy guy, I probably over speed every time but it can\u0026rsquo;t be too much. Regardless, I only got the 300 cc bike.\nThis reminds me of the English learning experience, I spent 10s of years leaning English grammar, the past tense, perfect tense and future tense and all the appropriate adjective. I never enjoyed it, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn well to be honest. After lots of trials, I notice just speak out and get some awkward or embarrassment would be the best for me to learn those tedious nuance, like those tense ,grammar or appropriate words. That\u0026rsquo;s why I come here, I hope to learn English and public speaking ability with you guys together.\n"

I was kind of dancing with between that\nI love being inspired I like being inspired, reading a life story of others always let me think about what if there is another path of my life, let me get some knowledge of life choice, life is about making choices, any of use can\u0026rsquo;t experience everything, we can learn from others' life story and make a best one for ourselves.\nI love profanity words God damn, I really love it. Those profanity words light me fighting will, those words are kind of like provoking, offenseing, anyone can be offsensed by any of those words and start a fight, and let\u0026rsquo;s have a fight. It\u0026rsquo;s like an art, you are alright to use some words in some situation but sometimes you got scewed for different people of different situation, it\u0026rsquo;s like playing at the brink of dangerous, it\u0026rsquo;s so fun.\nEven though I\u0026rsquo;m a really mild person, but I do enjoy this kind of risk, maybe I do like a fight as well.\n"

        "body": "To be an adventurist Intrigue I have been reading the book \u0026ldquo;Principle\u0026rdquo; written by Ray Dalio for few months, I really like this guy and the way he thinks about things. There is one excerpt impressed me, Ray sent his then 11 yo son Matt to China for one year, when the time China didn\u0026rsquo;t even have unlimited hot water at night, Ray likes China, he thought China has a huge potential, he wanted to have some connection with China, of course he provided his son with safety and basic needs. Somebody might think that\u0026rsquo;s selfish or cruel, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s a brilliant idea. I grew up in China and just moved to US few years ago, living in total different society and culture really teaches me a lot, I can\u0026rsquo;t help thinking what if I could\u0026rsquo;ve lived in a totally different culture for few years besides China, that would be interesting and inspiring, for example, Japan, yeah, I might send my kid to Japan for 1 or 2 years if I could have the chance. This excerpt reminds me Jeff Bezos once mentioned in an interview, \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;d rather his kids lost one figure but being resourceful\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s why he gave his kids to use knife when they were really young. I think that\u0026rsquo;s bold, and I like it.\nLooking back my own experience I\u0026rsquo;ve played roller skating for years, I enjoyed it. This sport was very popular in China, special between kids and teenagers. For people really seriously play, there are two paths to level up. One is freestyle slalom which play tricks around some small cones, it requires tons of skills and practices, those tricks are amazing, some of them might look unbelievable which usually make audience dazzled. Another path is freestyle braking or sliding, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know the technical term. This one is just braking abruptly with some freestyle tricks while you\u0026rsquo;re in a high speed. It\u0026rsquo;s more like stunt, the tricks in freestyle braking usually makes bystanders feel nervous or breathtaking instead of excited. Because bad luck and happens the player can get insured severely, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a friend broke his hand just in front of me. And I chose this path. I liked it so much, I specially enjoy the breathtaking moment, you either nail it or screw it, it\u0026rsquo;s very simple format in those stunts, but it requires a strong determination while you stick on it. I spent most majority time playing the freestyle braking, I\u0026rsquo;ve fell thousands of times, luckily I haven\u0026rsquo;t got hurt seriously yet.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m doing now I\u0026rsquo;ve always asked myself, what do I really enjoy while doing those tricks while taking the risk. Well, first of all, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that risk is totally out of my control, actually we can control most majority part more than normal people think, and there is a huge maneuverable gap between fall alright vs fall unprotected, just outsider can\u0026rsquo;t grasp the split second.\nI treated this kind of exercise as practice of my willpower and focus ability. I think part of reason is this just part of my nature, like dogs needs run out every day to have some exercise which make them happy, I need to take some risk, solve some uncertainty to let me release some adrenaline, let me feel alive.\nThe same as I was riding motorcycle on commute before the pandemic happens, I really enjoyed the adrenaline spike on the motorcycle. Unlike driving a car which usually pretty relax, hitting a freeway with motorcycle is very much like an adventure. You\u0026rsquo;re the most vulnerable object on the road, you gotta to be serious, you gotta to be aggressive because you are often got ignored which can be catastrophic.\nLooking forward As these kind of exercise or sports they are just my personal plays, I\u0026rsquo;d like to have meaningful fight in adventure in the real world, hopefully benefit the society. How am I gonna do that, well, I think the best for me would be either pioneer an new area or project in a stable company like Walmart or ideally start my own business. As an engineer, I like to solve problem, special solve problem in a engineering way, there are so many problems in our society, I\u0026rsquo;d like to help people kill a few if I have a chance. As one wish Ray Dalio in the book \u0026ldquo;Principle\u0026rdquo; have mentioned, \u0026ldquo;I hope you struggle well\u0026rdquo;, yeah, look back my life experience, I made most of friends during work, most of my enjoyable moments through work on difficult project in difficult times, either I made it or I failed, I become stronger than before. I will try to myself more meaningful struggle and fight them through.\nThanks you!\n"

        "body": "Why Trump keeps saying Chinese Virus in my opinion I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert on politics, actually on the contrary, I\u0026rsquo;ve very limited knowledge about politics, since I\u0026rsquo;ve just lived in the US for 3 years, I\u0026rsquo;m very amazed by the abundance of politic news and it really interact with our daily life which not a thing in China. But living in this country having so-called freedom of expression, I have every right to express my random opinion, I just want to write something down to help myself to understand things and improve my English writing ability incidentally.\nHe just enjoys fighting I feel him, because I\u0026rsquo;m like him in that perspective (I don\u0026rsquo;t like him in any way for sure 😅), I enjoy challenging and being challenged by others, I enjoy the thrilling of fighting, in any fashion, it makes feel alive.\nIn this case, it was triggered by the Chinese foreign minister spokesman brought the idea that the coronavirous might come from the US, it surprised lots of people for sure. Since the notorious swept across the globe, everybody is suffering, the most discouraging thing is we don\u0026rsquo;t know when and how it would be ends, looks like the global economy is in the brink. But one things is for sure for every reasonable and well-informed person, it\u0026rsquo;s come from China, Wuhan specifically. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense throw the bullshit to the US as foreign minister spokesman. In my opinion, Trump or his team has the right to be ruffled, so he just grab this opportunity and start a fight.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure others, as for me, I really hate the feeling of shooting in the dark. I enjoy the feeling of focus and having clear direction. The virus is so new and there are so much mysterious which depresses us, in this well-tensioned moment, get a target to fight is more fun then just do nothing. I can image the US gov exec already hold grudge on the Chinese government about the information transparency. It\u0026rsquo;s like you\u0026rsquo;re holding some grudge on another person and he started the fight accidentally, well, good timing, let\u0026rsquo;s get fire burn.\nOf course I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of keeping saying \u0026ldquo;Chinese Virus\u0026rdquo;, it would definitely bring lots of racism chaos, and most of all, the Chinese people has nothing to do with it. I can\u0026rsquo;t help thinking what would Obama say in this kind of scenario, I think he would handle it in a very political way, give a well-thought speech, nobody get hurt, maybe even including the culprit. I remember there is joke \u0026ldquo;Speaking like Obama\u0026rdquo;, saying people speak too slick which is trick and powerless, like a typical politician maybe. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I like Obama a lot, I got inspired by his speech a lot. I just understand if you want to bring an opinion, a good chance you\u0026rsquo;d ruffle someone, Trump just chose the outrageous and relentless approach, and he was always acting like that, does anybody really surprise? His supporters like his stuboorn, sinceer or \u0026hellip;\nTo distract attention "

        "body": "Why don\u0026rsquo;t they panic Recently with the CoronaVirus tension ramps up, I started thinking about buy some face masks just in case, but both offline shops and online retailers all out of stock. Shit, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen numerous news about those Chinese guys\nThey have the basic trust in Government and news media It' quite ironic people in China they trust and rely on government so much, but every time any dire situation happens, they got in panic very fast and started looking all kinds of rumors. I think at bottom of their heart, they know how government works, they know their dear gov might sacrifice some one but just don\u0026rsquo;t know who will be, they can\u0026rsquo;t blindly depend on them. They\u0026rsquo;d better prepare something for themselves, looking for grapevines in case gov won\u0026rsquo;t disclose truth, stocking up for family in case shops can\u0026rsquo;t meet the supply.\nOn the contrary, Americans always criticizing the gov, they always saying the gov is not worth truasting, the gov is very inefficient, the news media all full of fake news. But as the situation getting worse, I don\u0026rsquo;t see the normal Americans panic, they live their life as normal, even though gov and news media keep escalating the warnings, nobody can force them putting masks on their face.\nThey have strong mind There is no doubt in general Western people have stronger mind comparing with Asians. As people feel strong and value the independence, they are just not easy to get panic. As stereotype shows, most Asian have weak ego, submissive personality, like sheeps are easy to get panic and lost their mind.\nThey didn\u0026rsquo;t experience that many hard-times as we do Maybe because of history experience, special my parents' generation, they have been through many artificial difficulties (disasters), so many of their fellow have been sacrificed, or their social positions been through roller coasters. Like people have been bite by a snake, they would be much easier get scared by ropes.\nIn America, people\u0026rsquo;s life style has been constant for decades, they have the fundamental trust in their society.\n"
