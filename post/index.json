        "body": "\nHow it started I\u0026rsquo;ve been alone for a while, and I\u0026rsquo;m getting old(30+), I started feeling the urgency to get a partner in crime. So I asked around, people always ask back \u0026ldquo;what kind of girl are you looking for? \u0026quot; I hate not able to articulate that well, so I decided to write it down, since there is nothing secret about it.\nBasically I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a girl who is just like me, sound quite narcissistic, but that\u0026rsquo;s my genuine feeling. Maybe because I\u0026rsquo;m quite self-contained and happy, I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to break it, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some couples hold quite different values / lifestyles, and living together unhappy, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be like that.\nOf course people are different, something is easy for me might be difficult for another person. I can take compromise, I just dump them all out of my mind, we can treat them as reference, not rules.\nValues I look for Positive / optimistic I\u0026rsquo;m an optimistic and happy person in general, and I value it. I live by hope, as opposite to not fear, stress or other stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to see progress or improvement, that\u0026rsquo;s the main driver for my day to day life.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to work / live with negative / pessimistic person, even though I know sometimes I know their points are valid, but if there is no hope or action taken place, I\u0026rsquo;d not enjoy whining about them.\nThis is not to see we don\u0026rsquo;t complain or try to solve problem, people around me probably know I\u0026rsquo;m quite critical on lots of things, and I see it as a tough love, and hoping to change.\nReceptive / Open-minded I\u0026rsquo;m from China, as much as I love American/Western culture, I can\u0026rsquo;t deny that deep down I\u0026rsquo;m still a Chinese. I think ideally she is Asian descendant or into Asian culture.\nI\u0026rsquo;m quite open-minded, and I enjoy learning new things(tools/ideas/concepts), and anything contributes my self-improvement.\nFor example, in this year 2022, I\u0026rsquo;ve embarked fermentation journey(Sauerkraut, Kombucha, kamichi, yogurt etc), learning MBTI and stoicism, just to name a few, and I\u0026rsquo;ve probably invested 100+ hours in each of them, and I\u0026rsquo;d be thrilled to talk about them anytime.\nNot necessary my partner needs to like/agree whatever I\u0026rsquo;m pursuing, but I hope to see she has similar mindset, ideally we can learn and grow together.\nSupportive, feminine My ideal partner would be compassionate, loving, considerate etc, just some common feminine traits I guess.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not a \u0026ldquo;male chauvinistic\u0026rdquo; person, on the contrary, I see myself as a moderate feminist. I like independent people, but strong-minded/feisty female would not my ideal choice.\nLifestyles I look for Abstraction vs Sensing In MBTI parlance, I\u0026rsquo;m a \u0026ldquo;Ni\u0026rdquo; (Introverted Intuitive) person, I\u0026rsquo;m drawn into abstraction(not tangible materials/experience).\nFor example, my common table topics are economy, business, power, psychology, tools(software, ideas, little gadgets) etc, and I often found myself despise those material, superficial, sensual stuff / experience. For example, fine dining, clothing, \u0026ldquo;excessive cleaning\u0026rdquo; etc.\nBringing this up not to put it as a requirement but to seek understanding, I know lots of people are not like me, I can understand it. And I hope my partner understand it as well.\nEmotion I\u0026rsquo;m quite emotionally stable, and I value it. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many people are not, and not even working on it, nor see it as a problem, that\u0026rsquo;s a big problem to me.\nI believe in stoicism, the very essence idea is accepting what you can\u0026rsquo;t control and having the courage to change what you can, and having the wisdom to tell the difference.\nMaintain a consistent light mood is essential for me, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect everyone, me included could achieve that easily, we could work on that at least.\nMoney I live quite modestly overall, I often joke about that my spending ability is like a new grad, and I\u0026rsquo;m actually proud of it. I came from a humble beginning, I have always been living below my means, I guess it probably applicable for most immigrants.\nSo I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be happy with people enjoy luxurious (money-wise) lifestyle. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean we can\u0026rsquo;t indulge ourselves with some worldly pressure, we certainly can, but just do it sparingly.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a big believer in investing, currently I\u0026rsquo;m mainly invested in risky assets (stock and crypto), I\u0026rsquo;d gradually move some of them to Real Estate and other safer assets. I hope my partner would not be a risk-averse person.\nActive I like all kinds of sports and workout, I enjoy maintaining a fit body. I hope my partner would enjoy physical active as well, and we can do something like hiking, kayaking in spare time.\nIn the end There you have it, just primarily \u0026ldquo;Values\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Lifestyles\u0026rdquo;, of course there are lots of others things I care, but above are just things top off my mind.\n"

        "body": "What issue I have now I started jotting down my notes digitally and plain text base for a while long time, I just wanted it simple, then one work.md and day.md started bloating, naturally I divide them into separate files for different purpose, e.g. \u0026ldquo;stock-trading-record\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;vim/tmux cheatsheet\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;linux common commands\u0026rdquo; etc, then I\u0026rsquo;ve got too many files and I often ended with lots similar and overlaps files.\nFolder, file\neffortless input, efficient retrieval\nI have been using local plain text files (Markdown) + Cloud storage for years, over time, I started feeling losing control of how I manage it. There are a handful of issues.\nToo many files I try to make each note file recording one thing and one thing only, so I could manage them relative easily. Over time, the root directory has got 10+ files, I realized I need to put them into different folders, I started adding more and more. E.g. Info/cheatsheet, Info/cheatsheet/vim, info/cheatsheet/tmux, info/reading-thoughts, learn/toastmasters, learn/docker, strategy/career-roadmap, work/work.md etc etc.\nThese comes two issues, one is I often have hard time to choose which content should I put into which file, for example, I got some thoughts about investing psychology, should I put into learning/investing.md or xxxx/psychology, I drains my energy to decide which is the best destiny for the fleeting thought.\nAnother issue is after I\u0026rsquo;ve got 30+ files I often forgot their existence, I ended up creating similar but duplicated/overlaps files. I tried to put all file reference in README.md and it gets back to the first issue, some files are not belong to specific folder or there are some overlaps, it makes me reluctant to organize it.\nHard to find my resources What I\u0026rsquo;m excited about Logseq Local first \u0026amp; non intrusive I really appreciate Logseq doesn\u0026rsquo;t mess with my local files, instead it creates its own database to reference my local files, and create tags file in its own folder, it\u0026rsquo;s delicate and elegant. I can continue using Git to do source control, it makes me feel so safe, I have commits for each milestones, as long as .git exists, I\u0026rsquo;d not lose any content and content change history.\nI can still use Vim as main editor to write everything, and delegate Logseq to manage tagging and references.\nNo files, no folders, everything is block No files/folders, no hustle, everything relationship management hands off to logseq(it\u0026rsquo;s tags and database), that\u0026rsquo;s awesome!\nsearch tags/blocks is way esier than files.\nTags and Bi-directional links I\u0026rsquo;ve always know I love tags, I loved tags in Evernote, and I hated it I can\u0026rsquo;t find an easy way to have tags in Notion. Logseq makes reference tags and creating tags easy and immersive, because there is no \u0026ldquo;file\u0026rdquo;, I can make tags\nthe auto-completion of tags, links are amazing, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know I love it so much until I use it. I have always been bothered to other files (again, files suck), but the effortless reference really connected my knowledge map.\nthe reverse reference is amazing, mind opening. In a hindsight, this is what it should be for a knowledge management.\nWhenever I write a block, I give it a tag, I can see myself reference it later in future in an accumulated page, that\u0026rsquo;s a very good feeling and positive feedback to push me write more.\nGraph View, see big picture Go back/forward This is a small little feature comparing others, but I like it so much. CMD-[ / CMD-] to go back and forth the pages you\u0026rsquo;ve browsed, I use it 100+ times a day, it makes mindless browsing so easy.\nOpen source first, vibrant community I haven\u0026rsquo;t really get myself involved in any open source project but as a consumer of lots of them. But I can see myself would get envolved in the future. Especially when the organizer\u0026rsquo;s ideas drifting away from mine, I have the last resort to fork the source code and keep and maintain what direction I think is right.\nbonus point, the company develop \u0026amp; maintain the tool is a Chinese company but choosing English first and global first, I really like it and admire their spirit.\nIn the end I have 4 personal repos (notes, blog, Journal, English), I\u0026rsquo;m starting to merge notes and journals to one repo and see how it goes. For a long time, I questioned myself that I journal almost everyday, but I almost never looked back, it\u0026rsquo;s kinda pointless, I hope by taking advantage of the bi-directional links from logseq, it would let me travel back my history moments effortlessly.\nReference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBtKHwFBn0k\nBeyond primitives\nderivates, so much fun and potential Schedule "

        "body": "Intro I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of MBTI for years and only took the test in 16personalities few months ago, I loved it. As always, I regret that I didn\u0026rsquo;t start it earlier.\nI got my type identified as INTJ-A. The well-known people are \u0026ldquo;Little finger\u0026rdquo; in GOT, \u0026ldquo;Gandalf the Gray\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;The Lord of Rings\u0026rdquo;, Elon Musk, Friedrich Nietzsche etc.\nAs one of the rarest personality types – and one of the most capable – Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them.\nI do think this description fits me pretty well in a ballpark, I got a bit flattered of this characterization actually, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how practical and authentic this test is, as I\u0026rsquo;m always quite suspicious about psychology test. Out of curiosity, I joined a online MBTI meetup the other day, I was amazed by the enthusiasm of those members, and the endless analysis of those different types, and the unlimited resources of MBTI on internet, more importantly, I was challenged that I might not be an INTJ, as the host put \u0026ldquo;some people might like the identity of INTJ, who would like to consider themselves as INTJ, but actually live in their own little delusional bubble and only surround themselves with people who validate them\u0026rdquo;\nOf course I don\u0026rsquo;t buy this argument, so I\u0026rsquo;d like to break it down and figure it out.\nI watched This video back and forth multiple times, I really appreciate his insights, I can try to regurgitate his ideas and try apply them in my life.\nI for Introverted, as opposed to Extroverted There is no doubt that I\u0026rsquo;m introverted, I spend most of time alone everyday, and I need way more time alone than with people. Most of time social activity isn\u0026rsquo;t my thing. I value peace of mind than fun activity. Though I do like to interact with people sometimes, especially the topic and activity I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about, I could talk a lot like an extrovert.\nN for Intuition, as opposed to Sensory This kind of person are drawn into abstraction, something like process, optimization, summary etc.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always noticed myself not a \u0026ldquo;down to the earth\u0026rdquo; person. I\u0026rsquo;m just not excited about those sensual things, like food, scenery, life experience etc (ofc I do like them occasionally). I found myself often drawn into economy(mainly macro economy), finance, stock option trading, politics, psychology, business, strategies etc.\nProcess instead of get things done I\u0026rsquo;ve always interested in how things work, especial abstract and pervasive things, for example, how society work, why some society is more productive/resilient than others.\ntransient pleasure I have very little interest in trivial things (don\u0026rsquo;t mean they\u0026rsquo;re not important), or some sensory pleasure. For example, I\u0026rsquo;m quite easygoing with food, lots of people around me (most from Asia) having issue with American/western food, or they crave for Asian food, I\u0026rsquo;m an outlier. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty chill with whatever decent food I could get, I\u0026rsquo;m not eager to get better tasty food if not necessary. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I do appreciate tasty food, I do like Asian food way more than western food in general, but just my motivation \u0026amp; cravings are quite weak, I don\u0026rsquo;t need them very often.\nInstead I care way more in the healthy \u0026amp; nutrient side of the food, how my body likes them (besides of tongue), how could I tame my body to like the \u0026ldquo;right diet\u0026rdquo;. How could I make it more cost effective as money/time/energy perspective as I need to cook everyday under the forever pandemic. The same behavior in me applies to clothing, travel, entertainment, the list goes on and on. I\u0026rsquo;m a lousy consumer in this consumerism prevailed world.\nAbstraction My interest area is quite broad and strong, most are far-fetched ideas, as opposed to \u0026ldquo;down to the earth\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about crypto/blockchain, finance, psychology, economy and politics etc, I talk loud and nonstop when topics fall into those area and I often don\u0026rsquo;t notice myself.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t usually take things as their face value, especially when things surprised me, I\u0026rsquo;d ask a lot of \u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rdquo;, then I\u0026rsquo;d let it go and try not let it happen again.\nLots of things I do not only for the result, but during the process how it trains me regarding skills, mentality etc, and the expected/unexpected consequence associated. For example, one of my favorite, stock market investing. Of course I\u0026rsquo;d hope to make money in the end, but for the day to day operations, I treat it as a training. Filtering the enormous of financial data and analysis, taming my fear \u0026amp; greed mentality during different situations, learn and observe how the society, business and economy work, and inevitable it gets into politics and government policies. And most importantly for me, stock market \u0026amp; economy, they\u0026rsquo;re not hard science, which means there always lots of different answers and predictions, this makes it so interesting to me.\nfascinate by the idea, not to help with anything. talk about idea just for the idea\nT for Thinking, as opposed to Feeling For myself and the Asian culture I grew up with, it\u0026rsquo;s very natural to downplay or even suppress feelings. I value thinking way more than feelings.\nThere are few times, friends(very closed) called me out that I ignored their feelings, most of times I didn\u0026rsquo;t really feel that, either consciously or unconsciously.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also a fan of Stoicism, one things I learned from it is not only letting go feeling / emotions, but deliberately practice those tough/exuberant things and train your mind to watch and tame it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been a big fan of stoicism, the essence of stoicism is let go of ego, emotions, like a cow staying there and being indifferent of all weather. Threat all unexpected, setbacks as expected, even train yourself to get over the emotions, emotions are natural burden, we get way more free when we don\u0026rsquo;t get attached with them.\nLack of creativity\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to disassociate my own feeling/energy/motivation with anything in my face, instead I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to setup a system that feedback my energy/interest selectively. for example, I try to be active, proactive, encourage in the work environment, I won\u0026rsquo;t get discouraged by inactive response, that\u0026rsquo;s just my preferred style, of course I won\u0026rsquo;t be pushy(might be preachy).\nJ for Judging, as opposed to perceiving I\u0026rsquo;m not sure Judging and Perceiving are the best words for describing these two personalities. Judge is an sensible word, I rarely judge others (at least publicly or overtly), I do judge myself a lot, and I\u0026rsquo;m quite opinionated on things I care.\nI like things in order, abstract things instead of physical, I can\u0026rsquo;t say my physical belongingness are very organized. But for my career, investing, my routine(eating, sleeping, workout), I do pay a lot of attention and I spent lot of time optimizing and making sure they\u0026rsquo;re on the right trajectory.\nI rarely being spontaneous, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like myself being that most of time, I enjoy living in sober and level-headed, I treat everything as an investment, and I aspire to engineer my life and life events as much as I can. It might sound cold, but radical rationality is cold (Though I think I\u0026rsquo;m a warm person).\n"

        "date" : "2022.08.01",
        "body": "Intro Hello fellow Toastmasters, today we\u0026rsquo;re gonna talk about \u0026ldquo;Communication styles.\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t know there is a thing called \u0026ldquo;communication styles\u0026rdquo; until I started preparing this speech and took the quiz, they are 4 styles in total, they are \u0026ldquo;supportive\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;direct\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;initiative\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;analytical\u0026rdquo;. After took the quiz, I got to know my two dominant styles are supportive and direct. I loved it, I do think it makes sense as much as I know myself. Some people might be wondering, isn\u0026rsquo;t these two contradicting with each other? Well, let me explain.\nSupportive Style First, the supportive style, there is an example: few weeks ago a sunny Wednesday after work, I went to indoor rock climbing with my roommate Eric, it was fun and we had a good time there, we met a friend Jason he proposed that we go out for a quick bite after this intense workout.\nThat sounds like a great idea, but I was and still now practicing 16:8 intermittent fasting, which I\u0026rsquo;m not supposed to eat after 8 pm, at that moment it was already 8 pm. I hesitated for a second, and I told myself that rules are supposed to be broken on occasion, it should not be a big deal. So I responded \u0026ldquo;Yes, let\u0026rsquo;s do it!\u0026rdquo;\nThen there comes next question, \u0026ldquo;what kind of food should we go?\u0026rdquo; I said I like Ramen, or there is a Chipotle closeby as well. But they were like \u0026ldquo;Nah.\u0026rdquo; Jason proposed \u0026ldquo;How about chick-fil-A? It\u0026rsquo;s just across the street.\u0026rdquo; Eric was pretty much onboard with that. But it really puts me off, the last thing I want is deep fried fast food. But within seconds, I talked over myself: \u0026ldquo;we just had an intense workout, it should\u0026rsquo;ve killed tons of calorie, it should be alright.\u0026rdquo; Then we went there and it was delicious.\nIn a hindsight, it not uncommon for me to \u0026ldquo;wrest my arms\u0026rdquo; in order to fit in, not only communication but interaction with people in general.\nDirect style Well, there is another side of me, the \u0026ldquo;Direct\u0026rdquo; me, I sometimes being called blunt for that. For example, last time in a party one of my friend Bishal approached me and asked a question, which he has asked me many times, \u0026ldquo;is this a good time to buy Bitcoin?\u0026rdquo; I replied without thinking for a second \u0026ldquo;Yes, this is a good time, nobody can really time the market, so any time is a good time. And don\u0026rsquo;t ask me the same question.\u0026rdquo; He said \u0026ldquo;Okay\u0026rdquo; and then walked away, I knew he probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the answer, and he might be offended a bit. And I\u0026rsquo;m Okay with it.\nYes, I literally told him \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t ask me the same question\u0026rdquo; in front of his face, some people might frown upon this kind of \u0026ldquo;rudeness\u0026rdquo;. Of course I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to hurt him in any regard, and I\u0026rsquo;m also not a financial pro as well, I was just expressing what\u0026rsquo;s really in my mind.\nI know many people have problem saying NO in front of others, I\u0026rsquo;m the same when I\u0026rsquo;m being the \u0026ldquo;supportive style\u0026rdquo;. But when topics fall into what I have confidence in or I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about, I become a \u0026ldquo;Direct\u0026rdquo; me. Topics like crypto, stock market, programming, productive tools/hacks etc.\nIn the end Here you have it, fellow Toastmasters, that\u0026rsquo;s my two dominant communication styles, supportive and direct. How do you like it, what\u0026rsquo;s your communication style, let me know and we can discuss about it offline.\n"

        "body": "\nI often got asked about \u0026ldquo;tell me about yourself\u0026rdquo; and I got awkward and I don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start, so I am thinking why don\u0026rsquo;t I just have a dedicated place to dig through my soul, what differentiate myself with others, so here it is. Of course I\u0026rsquo;m biased, as my view conflicts with my own interest 😃.\nThere are could be primarily 3 traits I cherish them as my identity. Growth mindset, stoic and risk taking, ofc there are a lots of miscellaneous items I can list them in the end.\nGrowth Mindset I stumbled on this video just a year ago, it illustrated the idea of growth mindset vs fixed mindset pretty well, and I immediately knew that\u0026rsquo;s it, growth minset is one of my most distinguishable characteristic, and I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know the term.\nI like to learn, and I like to learn how to learn, I like to change and be adaptive. I\u0026rsquo;ve always have the most common topics with people craving to learn \u0026amp; change, I hate feeling stuck in the mud.\nThis is one fundamental reason I like science and IT industry in general, they just keep evolving, relentlessly. I often heard/saw people complaining in IT industry new grad can get compensated as good as people worked for 10 years, that\u0026rsquo;s because experience often isn\u0026rsquo;t that much valuable as other industry in IT, everything evolving way faster here. Comparing with those things don\u0026rsquo;t really change much for decades or even longer, such as traditions/ritual, religions, marriage system, education system etc, they are what they were decades ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been a fan of them. And I often found myself disparaging them relentlessly.\ngrowth stocks wild west crypto\nStoicism The word \u0026ldquo;stoic\u0026rdquo; commonly refers to someone who is indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy.[8] The modern usage as a \u0026ldquo;person who represses feelings or endures was first cited in 1579 as a noun and in 1596 as an adjective. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism.\nI\u0026rsquo;m generally calm and happy most majority of time, though I do get emotional on rare cases, but it has been rarer and rarer, as I\u0026rsquo;ve keeping learning myself and the world around me, I try to look at the world through radical rational lens, everything makes sense, if they don\u0026rsquo;t, I will try to dig into it. So I usually don\u0026rsquo;t get very happy or unhappy, no frustration or exciting, no drama, just keep making progress on things are important to me, onwards and upwards.\nI rarely celebrate anything, I feel windfall happen to me not worth celebrating, and for those things I strove really hard for a long time, the results are already the best reward, I\u0026rsquo;m gratified with them without additional activity.\nbuild resistance\nRisk taking People around me but don\u0026rsquo;t know me well would be surprised to know that I\u0026rsquo;m a risk taker. My daily behavior is quite deceptive, as I\u0026rsquo;m quite easygoing and carefree. But deep bottom of my heart, I\u0026rsquo;m actually quite enterprising and ambitious. I like to take challenges people don\u0026rsquo;t even dare to think of, it makes feel good.\nLooking back my grew up history, I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked sports, and I played many of them, such as biking, basketball, roller skating/blading, swimming, snowboarding(none of them I played well enough to stand out). The one stick with me the longest is roller skating/blading, I like those dangerous tricks the most, those freestyle stunts, those which either you make it or you go to hospital for it(luckily I never fall bad enough to go to hospital).\nMy favorite part of those stunts is they require split-second decision, I like the extremely focused status, the adrenalin spikes, the courage and determination, and I often inspired by those videos as well(I guess most of us do). I don\u0026rsquo;t mind get hurt in some extent, it\u0026rsquo;s par for the course, and it only makes me stronger and tougher.\nI feel lots similarities while riding motorcycle in freeway, unlike driving in the car, riding motorcycle is quite dangerous and intense, but it\u0026rsquo;s so much fun because of them.\nMiscellaneous slow-poke idealist emotional stable sapiosexual\nAnimal Person I love animals without a doubt, I follow cute animal public accounts in all social media platforms I use. I feel genuinely happy when I see cute animals, \u0026ldquo;Thedodo\u0026rdquo; is my favorite public account. I like both 🐱 and 🐶. Though I feel cat is cuter in internet(I spent more time on cat photos and videos), but I like dogs the most. I admire and appreciate those natural traits of dogs, such as loyalty, braveness and optimism, communication etc. One of my ideal house would be having a small farm in the backyard, I can plant some vegetables and raise some small cute animals.\nAmbivert I\u0026rsquo;m not an introvert person, I do like social in some extent, and good vibes and laughs. I talk a lot when people or topic I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with or interested in, I prefer over communicate instead of under communicate.\nI like to exert my influence/endeavor to make things becoming better. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have many friends social life, I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of gathering or party, social events drain my energy significantly. I rarely contact any of my friends which I know I should do more.\nOpen-minded I\u0026rsquo;m very open-minded and adaptive, I\u0026rsquo;m a typical progressive liberal in America\u0026rsquo;s political spectrum, I\u0026rsquo;m open to a lots of novel ideas, I often got mind blown by those different ideas, and I enjoy exploring them. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of lots of traditions no matter what culture it belongs or how long it has been adherent.\nOptimist I\u0026rsquo;m a natural optimist, I tend to believe things are promising in life or society. I tend to look for changes, or make changes, either physically or mentally, consciously or unconsciously. I believe changes bring good, I\u0026rsquo;d rather make changes with mistakes than stay put with regrets.\nradical rational I\u0026rsquo;m quite rational, I like to do analyze and solve problem. I believe on making good decisions every day would is the essence of progress, whether they\u0026rsquo;re big or small. I tend to reasoning the world/society around me, I only believe things can be scientific proved. For example, horoscope and religion are not my thing.\n"

        "body": "Overview Two years into the obnoxious pandemic, I\u0026rsquo;ve got so used to WFH. Though I still struggle to figure out eating every day, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think we\u0026rsquo;d ever go back to office on daily basis. A brand new work/life style is opening to us, I\u0026rsquo;m so excited to see what would happen, I\u0026rsquo;ve always dreamed to be a digital nomad.\nI moved out of Bay Area in July, after staying there for 4 years, there are many happy and bitter memories, and I would probably forget them soon. I left quietly, no fuss. I will go back when I feel like to, it\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal.\nI finally transferred myself into Backend job position, I think I made the right decision, I never looked back, nor open the shitty clumsy Xcode 🙅. I could finally use my favorite Vim editor to do my job, nothing makes me happier than this.\nI spent most majority of my spare time this year in learning investing, there are so much hypes and excitement in stock \u0026amp; crypto market 24/7, I learned a lot. But my portfolio has been drastically underperforming S\u0026amp;P or QQQ index almost the whole year(peaked in Feb), it sucks! But I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I got the blow early on in my investing journey, otherwise I\u0026rsquo;d be cocky and get over myself easily, the setback doesn\u0026rsquo;t really damp my enthusiasm, I know I\u0026rsquo;m just starting out and I would catch up eventually. I enjoy doing it, not only for the return/result, that\u0026rsquo;s the most important thing.\nI spent 1+ hour on average every day learning English on daily basis, mostly on expanding my vocabulary using spaced repetition, in my repo. I\u0026rsquo;ve get very comfortable with it, I used the practice 5+ years, though it\u0026rsquo;s slow and I don\u0026rsquo;t see it get done any time soon, but it\u0026rsquo;s the best way I could figure out at this moment.\nLooking back the last year, it\u0026rsquo;s very much transformative, I\u0026rsquo;m very happy about it. I settled 3 anchors for my life for the foreseeable years: Backend(Infra, security), investing(stock, crypto, Real Estate) and English(reading, speaking).\nThough I spent way too much time on stock market than anything else, way less time in BE learning-close to 0, it\u0026rsquo;s a colossal mistake. At current stage of my life and foreseeable years, my primary income, social interaction, sense of safety, belongingness come from my work, and I suck at it, it agonizes me everyday.\nCareer ✅ Vim/tmux setup for backend development I spent a decent amount of time setting up my dev environment in terminal, Vim \u0026amp; Tmux, they\u0026rsquo;re awesome! I\u0026rsquo;m so glad that I committed to them while there is nobody around me on my side, it makes me feel a bit lonely, but I have a big online community, and they\u0026rsquo;re huge! I\u0026rsquo;m proud of myself for my commitment and advancement, I\u0026rsquo;m still very green in those online communities, I need to work on it.\nPost: Setup Vim as a full-fledged IDE, TBD.\nNode.js, Devops in backend getting started The journey of transferring into backend isn\u0026rsquo;t easy, especially I\u0026rsquo;m in platform team which mainly on Infra \u0026amp; security, it\u0026rsquo;s very challenging. There are tons of stuff I need to learn, and I need to learn on the go, I got lost all the time. I appreciate my company and my manager and my teammates gave me the chance to learn, the impostor syndrome haunts me every work day. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I would get better next year.\nPost: 1 year into Backend, TBD\nLearning ✅ Vim Learning Vim is a life long journey, the more I learn the more I feel I\u0026rsquo;m just getting started. I finished another book \u0026ldquo;Mastering Vim quickly\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy for me to read, I learn most of those tricks \u0026amp; concepts here and there in internet over the years.\nPost: I use Vim everywhere, TBD\nStock market psychology, Options basics Finished most part of Meetkevin\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;stock \u0026amp; psychology of money\u0026rdquo; course, Investopedia\u0026rsquo;s stock option basics, and I spent huge amount of time reading Motley Fool and Investopedia\u0026rsquo;s newsletter. Watched 美投君 almost all the video on Youtube. I like them so much from bottom of my heart, I like to be in the market, I like to trade/bet base on my knowledge, looking at the world/society through investor\u0026rsquo;s lens makes me feel so good. I feel I\u0026rsquo;m more engaged in the society and economy.\nPost: 1 year into stock market, TBD\nEnglish (Reading, speaking, writing) I\u0026rsquo;m an old hand learning English, I\u0026rsquo;m fully convinced that vocabulary is my primary roadblock for blending into American society and my career advancement. I read/memorize those words every morning, night, weekend or whenever I got some free time.\nAlmost a decade ago I found Eudic, I have been a happy customer ever since. This year I found Anki, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty awesome and it\u0026rsquo;s got huge extensibility and vibrant community, I\u0026rsquo;m sparing some of job from Eudic to Anki.\nPost: Repeating 20 times for every new word, TBD\nHealth ✅ Neck issue My neck pain still bothers me every now and then, whenever I got stressed out on desk, I\u0026rsquo;d fall into bad posture and be paralyzed the next day. Hope I could get over it.\nPost: How I conquer my stiff neck problem, TBD\nworkout I do home workout most of time these days, mainly push up and pull resistance bands, I use Reventure balance board to do indoor balance practice when I can not go out stating.\nI found this thing called \u0026ldquo;Contrast shower\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s very interesting, it\u0026rsquo;s so easy, fun and fulfilling. I feel so much energetic/refreshed coming out of shower room every time, I\u0026rsquo;m glad I find another practice I can do in my lifetime.\nLife / Relationship ❓ Life 🤔 N/A\nDating I finally started dating after being single for years, it\u0026rsquo;s still weird to me spending too much time with somebody but my computer.\nFriends/family N/A\n"

        "body": "\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been playing skateboard for over a year now, the more I learn and practice this sport, the more I like it. Though my skills are far away from a pro, but I don\u0026rsquo;t need to be, I like this sport because of the benefits it gives back to me, the community I like and I can see myself playing it in the foreseeable future.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t see yourself doing it next 5-10 years, don\u0026rsquo;t do it, outsource or delicate to others if possible\nIt\u0026rsquo;s challenging and inspiring One of my testimony of being a risk-taking person is that I like \u0026ldquo;dangerous\u0026rdquo; sport, I like the high stakes moment, I found it while riding motorcycle in freeway, the adrenaline spike drives my soul.\nPlaying skateboard tricks are dangerous, there are not short stories about people got into hospital of minor mistakes. Actually just recently one of my favorite celebrity Nyja went to hospital for a surgery, but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop him, won\u0026rsquo;t stop me either.\nWhat it brings to me?\nPlaying skateboard is not for a faint of heart, it\u0026rsquo;s quite dangerous and challenging, and that makes it inspiring. There is no short of inspiring skateboarding videos in internet, in those half-pipes, those skate parks or common parks. Though those stunts are too far from amateur players like me I feel, but I can see myself playing it for years but not get bored.\nThrough playing those tricks, I\u0026rsquo;ve gained so much better at balancing, nimbleness, and courage on taking challenges, these traits I cherish a lot in life.\nActually I severely underestimated the difficulty of those skateboard tricks when I started. I\u0026rsquo;ve played roller skating for years, I was quite good at it, I thought I would ramp up in skateboard like a breeze, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t. 😅 I spent months just to be able to Ollie on flat ground in still, it\u0026rsquo;s a shame.\nlike-minded community risk-taking fit hippie, rebel\nThere are numerous skateboard tricks circulating in internet, which are too bold, some people might despise their boldness, some might get aspired, I\u0026rsquo;m the latter. I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself can master those tricks anytime soon, but even just imaging one day I could do that already makes me excited.\nThe general stereotype of skateboarders are grassroots, rebellious, cantankerous, I like it, it\u0026rsquo;s similar with people riding sport motorcycle, that makes me feel cool 😎.\nconvenience, affordability I can play alone, almost anywhere, and it\u0026rsquo;s quite affordable comparing with any other sport.\nI loved playing basketball when I was a teen, it\u0026rsquo;s convenient, sophisticated and fun. But after I stopped growing vertically, and being short in height is such a disadvantage for playing basketball. I\u0026rsquo;m very unhappy about it. I know that\u0026rsquo;s not anybody\u0026rsquo;s fault, I opted out despondently.\nRecently there is a fad that lots of people fascinating into skiing or snowboarding, I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked those balance required sport, especially snowboarding, it looks cool and I can play some tricks with it. I went to play a couple of times, and I found out it\u0026rsquo;s not very good for me to take it seriously.\nIn most of area you can only play snowboard couple of months in a year, all base on the lenient of weather. Usually you have to drive couple of hours to the snow field, since it is not convenient to get there, people usually play many hours non stop from mountain top to bottom, I usually get bored playing 1 or 2 hours.\nTo me, playing snowboarding is more like a social sport, a group of people hitting there and play together is a typical theme. As I\u0026rsquo;m not a social person(I\u0026rsquo;m not anti-social in any means), one of the reason I loved basketball is I can play myself all alone and enjoy it, which you just can\u0026rsquo;t do it in football, pingpong or tennis. I would expect the sports (or anything) I like, I spent most of time I\u0026rsquo;m progressing myself alone, and some occasional chances we hit up some friends sparking ideas together.\nOne thing I like about skateboard is it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require anything besides a board and willing. You can play in most of place you want, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much cost or maintenance(I\u0026rsquo;ve been tormenting my board for over a year, the maintenance is $0).\n"

        "body": "How it started I got an internet call(anonymous call) at 11 am, I hesitated a few seconds to answer because most of those calls are just scams, but I took it. It was a female voice saying she is a police officer and my motorcycle is found and it\u0026rsquo;s in Fremont, she wanted me to stop by ASAP. I was like, What??!! 😮😮 I got ecstatic immediately, my bike has gone missing over 2 weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve already crossed off my shopping list for my bike. I said I will be there very soon. I grabbed my helmet and gloves and thinking I might be better riding back in local instead of freeway in case it isn\u0026rsquo;t in a good shape, as always, I got too optimistic. 🙂\nOn spot I arrived the industrial area in Fremont, I got a feeling of gang fighting scene from movies. Deserted factories, ragged road, heavy-duty trucks buzzing around and etc. I approached the police car, officer Santana asked me to sign a acceptance paper, I asked \u0026ldquo;Where is my bike?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;there it is\u0026rdquo;, she pointed me to a RV. My bike was bonded with an RV with lots bruises on the body. Then I noticed the ignition lock has been ripped off, windshield and left mirror are gone. I definitely CAN NOT ride it home. 😩\nI started contacting my insurance agent for help, to my surprise, she acted cranky(even cruel I think). She responded \u0026ldquo;What do you want me to do for you? You\u0026rsquo;re not my customer anymore, I\u0026rsquo;m crossing off your name in my customer list\u0026rdquo;, I was like, ❓❓❓ 😮 that\u0026rsquo;s unexpected!\nI was very inexperienced and helpless and being stranded on the road, I knew my insurance expired (it expired two weeks ago before the bike got stolen which is another bummer), she has all the right not to help me, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand why she chose to burn the bridge, she can simply disguise her indifference by providing some empty friendliness, she hung up without giving any excuse, twice!! I was shocked. That\u0026rsquo;s unprofessional! I will try to use my influence (if I have or will have) to talk people away from her service from now on. She sucks! 😡\nThen I moved on trying to contact my friend for help, Officer Santana cruised back and told me that she wants me to get the bike out of the scene as soon as possible, she can\u0026rsquo;t leave without knowing my bike is out this spot. Because the person being arrested will be released today and he might come back anytime, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want me get into trouble. I was like WTH 😮! Though it\u0026rsquo;s my bike but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to fight a \u0026ldquo;criminal\u0026rdquo; with his prey. I also felt warm that she came back to inform me, she cared about me, even she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know me at all, comparing with Joana, Officer Santana is so kind. After a few seconds thought, I decided to manual roll the bike to a safer place, I rolled it into a building few blocks away.\nTowing options The next thing is towing it away. I decided not to tow it back home since it requires immediate repair. I contacted a motorcycle transport service, the guy replied me that he just had a motorcycle accident which needs to stay in bed for 1-2 weeks. What? 😮 I suddenly feel so grateful that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any motorcycle accident, bike being stolen isn\u0026rsquo;t the worse thing can happen. Then I contacted another motorbike mover, he asked for $125, I agreed. If my insurance is still valid, I could\u0026rsquo;ve saved the money and these hassles.\nMy phone somehow was wacky the whole day, threw wrenches in my works. i.e. I can not turn on camera taking photo, can not load map while using Google/Apple map. After hours of frustration I realized that I upgraded an iOS Beta version last night, how the helll I would know I\u0026rsquo;d be out for the whole day, and alone. I was so helpless when my phone stopped working, my phone is my everything when I\u0026rsquo;m outside, for phone calls, for maps, for Google search and take pictures etc.\nRepair options After 1 hour drive on the towing car, my bike got into RMC moto, the mechanic gave me the estimate around $1400, my heart sunk. I hoped it could below $1000, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid to spend too much on this bike since I rarely use it, but I still like it, I guess I will go with that.\nConclusion Today is Thanksgiving, one of the most important holiday in America, I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful that I got my bike back. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a careless person, I\u0026rsquo;ve lost many precious stuffs in the past. Every time when bad luck happens, I whisper to myself \u0026ldquo;Come on, give me a second chance, I will be more careful\u0026rdquo;. This is the first time I\u0026rsquo;m given the second chance, Even though I might need to spend thousand of bucks to repair it, the second chance wasn\u0026rsquo;t given for free, I\u0026rsquo;m fine with that. 😇\nThe stocks I own soared both yesterday and today, I made $4400 (on paper) just today which is the best day since I started investing in stock market, specially the S\u0026amp;P 500 dropped around 0.5%, I feel cool and grateful. I got some money for my harmed bike. And I went out almost a whole day (11 am to 5 pm) I almost didn\u0026rsquo;t do any work today, but nobody complains, I even didn\u0026rsquo;t need to ask permission to leave, I don\u0026rsquo;t take the permissiveness for granted, I thank my teammates/manager and my company. 😇 😘\n"

        "body": "As I crossed the age of 30, I started realizing the importance of values and principles that how I approach things and problems. And I read the book \u0026ldquo;Principle\u0026rdquo; from Ray Dalio, I\u0026rsquo;d like to write the principles I follow, they\u0026rsquo;re subjected to change but I don\u0026rsquo;t see they\u0026rsquo;re changing anytime soon.\nEnglish first I\u0026rsquo;ve been learning English for almost 20 years(most part of my life), it\u0026rsquo;s quite embarrassing for me to admit that there is still long way to go, I wasted most of the time in China learn and forget in class. I\u0026rsquo;m glad currently I\u0026rsquo;m in a English speaking environment which reminds me that I\u0026rsquo;m not enough every single day, I see my progress regarding to vocabulary, reading, listening ability, not much speaking and grammar perspective, I do think I can conquer them in my 30s.\nI like English, I often amazed by the abundant and diverse information out there in English world(mainly online), it\u0026rsquo;s magnitude larger than Chinese or any other language. It\u0026rsquo;s essential for me to interact with people from different background and culture. I learn the western culture as well while learning English, I do see there is a big difference in \u0026ldquo;Western culture\u0026rdquo; vs Eastern Asian culture, it\u0026rsquo;s worth another post.\nI cherish my Chinese heritage, but as I\u0026rsquo;m aspiring to be an entrepreneur and digital nomad, I know English is one of the essential skill for me. Another part is I ardently hate the censorship in China and CCP controlled internet(which is almost all Chinese community I can reach), the prevalence of distortion and manipulation is staggering, and most people I know have got used to it, I found it very detrimental, as we\u0026rsquo;re getting fed with continuously and unlimited information online everyday. I decided to distant myself from it.\nI mostly only listen English music, only watch English movies / TV shows, read English written books. Sometimes I found myself hard to think about a Chinese word while talking with my Chinese friends, and I started reading Chinese writings slower than English, that\u0026rsquo;s the sacrifice I\u0026rsquo;m willing to take.\nSacrifice my Chinese fluency by putting English first.\nDigital first Software is eating up the world, and it\u0026rsquo;s just getting started.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember where did I see this quote years ago, and it still holds true and will be like this for a while I think. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I took on this trip at very beginning of my career.\nI try to have very minimum physical belongingness, as I keep moving around in my 20s, though in my 30s I would probably don\u0026rsquo;t move that much but I would still be the same, I just don\u0026rsquo;t have attachment in physical items. For example, I talked with some people they do agree e-books have insurmountable benefits over paper books, but they just like the feeling of reading on later, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, I don\u0026rsquo;t that feeling control me.\nDigital first, physical second.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t fight them, join them. I will still be conservative though.\n1000+ notes is just not manageable in phsycial.\nScale, matrix, ghost in the shell\nOpen and transparent Anything worth doing worthy doing publicly.\nOpen to change/challenge, transparent: keep the progress/setbacks visible, no big blockbuster kind.\nsocial media\nI believe in open and transparency, in contrast to proprietary, exclusiveness, conspiracy, mystery etc.\nI admire people has their public figure, product, I aspire to be like them.\nAs in software world, open source is undoubtedly overwhelmingly taking over the proprietary world, and it has been proven safe, secure, prosperity. I aspire to join and contribute a open source community.\nOpen source first.\nThere is no secrete shortcut\nDo hard things I first heard the concept from reading \u0026ldquo;Learn Python the hard way\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Learn Vimscript the hard way\u0026rdquo;, I was mesmerized by the idea of \u0026ldquo;do things the hard way\u0026rdquo;. I knew I\u0026rsquo;m not very smart since young age, and I gradually realized being smart isn\u0026rsquo;t very necessary to be a great person, on the contrary, sometimes it becomes a burden. Those people I admire or look up to, they all have gone through very tough battles which made their story worthy telling, I\u0026rsquo;d like to be one of them.\nAim high and achieve middle.\nI take pride in doing things hard and challenging, it\u0026rsquo;s very fulfilling.\nI identify myself as a hardcore person, I like to conquer big challenges, something so hard people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even consider it. On the contrary, I hate putting my efforts on things are easy. For example, when I was working on iOS App development full-time, it kills me when people say if doing iOS dev is easy, of course, that\u0026rsquo;s not 100% true, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to deny it feels easier than something like cyber security, distributed system, architecture etc.\nStock market is hard, Skateboarding is hard, Ergodox keyboard is hard,\nThings are so hard, people even not dare to think about it excites me the most.\nI hate to do things easy, especially I put most of my efforts/emphasis on. For example, when I was working on iOS App development full-time, it kills me\nI usually proud and feel fulfilled when I conquered something people would not even\nLooking back my own history, I gained most experience, skills, knowledge and even friendship through doing hard things.\nas I\u0026rsquo;m not very smart person in general, I admire hardworking spirit, and I believe hardworking is required for being exceptional. Looking back my own life experience, I got most fulfillment moment from the process of conquering hard issues, I gained the required skills, experience and friendship during those experience. For example, English, I put a lot deliberate efforts in it for years, I\u0026rsquo;m still far from my satisfying point, I know it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for an adult to master another language, and I know I would be proud of myself when I do.\nLong term thinking I like focus on long term for anything important, like career, investing, work out, health etc. Especially those things pay long term dividend in life, like reading, investing, writing etc.\nIf I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself doing it next 3-5 years, I don\u0026rsquo;t want bother to start.\nI have always been a slow mover, I do things slow, how I get by edge is being consistent and direction adjustment.\nHappy, Healthy and wealthy I learned the concept from reading the book \u0026ldquo;psychology of money\u0026rdquo;, essential everyone is looking these 3 things in life, \u0026ldquo;happy, health and wealth\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m no exception, but I feel I need to constant remind myself about them.\nI\u0026rsquo;m genuinely happy when I know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, and I know where I\u0026rsquo;m heading towards, that I have control in my life. I want to do great things, I want to be admired, I\u0026rsquo;m working on it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m pretty healthy in general.\nI\u0026rsquo;m far from being wealthy. I think that\u0026rsquo;s normal for a person come from a humble beginning. I\u0026rsquo;m quite positive that I would be well off in the future if I just keep doing what I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\n"

I did notice whenever I sit in front of my desk, my hands put on the surface of desk, the pressure either goes to my shoulder or I lay down more it goes to my lower back, no other way around. Until I found the footrest, it only takes $10+ bucks, I can vivid aware some of my upper body pressure goes to my foot which is awesome.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found stretching my body every once in a while during the day is a good habit to relax my body, specially for my wonky stiff neck. All of sudden I notice the toning ball in grocery outlet only cost $5 bucks, I started using it as an accompany during stretch since then. The ball is so comfort and versatile, I like it. 😸\nTrue color for Terminal Vim I\u0026rsquo;ve always been bothered by the anemic UI support in terminal vim. It\u0026rsquo;s just so bland and primitive, before that I thought I don\u0026rsquo;t care about UI at all, it taught me I do care in a basic level. I turned to MacVim for years for the basic UI support. Now things will turn around, the terminal vim has better color and contrast then the MacVim, it might be a game changer, I might turn back to terminal vim and work with Tmux multiple windows and sessions for all my writing tasks.\nVim smoothie plugin This plugin is recommend from email subscription of \u0026ldquo;Mastering Vim quickly\u0026rdquo;, at beginning I was suspicious of this unpopular plugin which just has just 100+ stars in Github then. I gave it a try, it struck me for the first few minutes❗.\nI never thought the scrolling in Vim should be smooth, but why not 😄? The user experience is so good, I can\u0026rsquo;t understand how I could I tolerate the bouncing jump, I can never go back.\nGoogle photos I went to Google photos just for the unlimited photo uploading for free (with some photo quality losing which is acceptable for me). As a person not that sensitive to privacy, I like Google a lot. I can lost or break my phone anytime, the most valuable assets are the photos/videos in my phone, it\u0026rsquo;s better have a cloud backup, automatically, painlessly. That\u0026rsquo;s a big mentally relief.\nThe feature abundance of Google photos really amazed me, I like it!\nTig \u0026amp; Git rebase interactive from Git I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved Git, I admire the stability, versatility and powerfulness from Git so much (Tho I started thinking Git does have bug as well, it struck me again since Git as an open source software we use all the time, but we almost assume it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have bugs).\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m kind of getting sick of the inconsecutive sequential commands in Git, the most notorious is the git stash, it\u0026rsquo;s just so inconvenient to check them up or clean them, lots of time we end up with tons of stash list we even can\u0026rsquo;t tell what are those shit inside, and we had to drop them all in batch which is awful practice. Another one like showing the content in the commit one by one is just drudgery work in terminal.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always loved those commands have the simplicity and easy to pipe ability in terminal, I thought I don\u0026rsquo;t care about UX much, Tig changed my idea, I do care. Tig provide the nice interactive terminal UI interface, I can make lots commands in consecutive, that\u0026rsquo;s awesome!\nAnother one is git rebase interactive, I\u0026rsquo;ve been amazed by how powerful and well-thought out about this subcommand. It might worth taking another post to illustrate, it gives me the ability and granular control of change history, like dancing in my repo, it\u0026rsquo;s so much fun.\n"

        "body": "All of a sudden everybody on WeChat started sharing their life moment of the same day 4 years ago, I realized today is the leap day for every 4 years. I started recollecting what\u0026rsquo;s my life like at the time. I spent 1 hour skimming on Wechat Moment, got some flash memories.\nI lost my luggage in my hometown I just got back to Shenzhen from my hometown Yueyang for the Chinese New Year break, where I lost my luggage in the trunk of a cab. I was very disappointed. 😩 I never thought someone would\u0026rsquo;ve taken my luggage . I even didn\u0026rsquo;t lock it (I still don\u0026rsquo;t have the habit of locking luggage). I didn\u0026rsquo;t take the receipt from cab driver, that\u0026rsquo;s a big mistake.\nI made numerous calls to the taxi coordination center, broadcasted the bounty from 200 RMB all the way to 4000 RMB in few days. I knew there are so many security cameras on the road for each traffic light, I knew the very precise time I passed those intersections, we should able to see the plate number for the cab as long as we have access.\nThen it started my first time in life seeking help from the local government, they disappointed me big time. Those people working there treating me as an uninvited visitor, they didn\u0026rsquo;t care what I need, just keep directing me to other government branches. I ended up visiting 7 branches in the small town, and they don\u0026rsquo;t give a damn. It\u0026rsquo;s quite ironical every government branch has a title \u0026ldquo;People\u0026rsquo;s xxx\u0026rdquo;, they don\u0026rsquo;t really care about local people. Actually I\u0026rsquo;ve always known those local government not responsive for local people, unless you have \u0026ldquo;关系\u0026rdquo; (aka internal relationship) or big money.\nIn a hindsight, if I booked from Didi or Uber that night, which the shared economy were surging at that time, it would be a whole different story(I\u0026rsquo;d have digital contact with the driver). As a self-professed tech hobbist, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been an advocate the tech solutions, I made a bad choice that time.\nWorking life As my work, I was very happy working in Jpush at the time. A new manager came to our team 1 month ago and we got along pretty well. I was living/working with a few bachelor colleagues 24/7. We were always staying in office very late because we got nowhere to go besides the office, that was a simple happy bachelor life memory. Before long, things started changing drastically, there was a huge miscommunication between me and the management and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know it until it broke out, I had to leave JPush unwillingly.\nI had a good time there, I made many friends (Though most of them we\u0026rsquo;re not in close touch any more). I learned the good lesson of communicating and managing up, I learned it a hard way.\nIf anyone thinks I\u0026rsquo;m good at communication, I started learning from that. 😼\nPreparing study abroad In the meantime, I was preparing for studying abroad the US. I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to checkout the world. I failed my study application 1 year ago, it was a seconds attempt and I had no clue what would happen.\nI vividly remember the recruiting staff Frank from the school gave me a call and started the conversation with “How are you doing today?\u0026quot; I got lost at that very beginning, all I knew for conversation starter is when people say “How are you”, you can respond “I\u0026rsquo;m fine, thank you!\u0026quot; I stuttered quite a while and brought up what I did in that day. 😅\nMy English was so bad, that was a hard time, I\u0026rsquo;m very glad I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through this far. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe coming to the US and lived here every since, that was the first time I went out of China(besides Taiwan). There was no accident, no surprise for my visiting, I had no relative or friend living in the US (I did have one in school which is AJie), it has been 4 years. Coming to the US is one of the best choice I made in my life, I\u0026rsquo;m very proud of that.\nBitcoin Right before I decided to come to the US, I sold all my Bitcoin/Litecoin holdings. At the time Bitcoin had been going sideways around $500 - $700 for 3 years. I bought them in 2013, I waited 3 years. I was about to start a new journey, I chose to reduce my uncertainty, even though I wasn\u0026rsquo;t short on money. I lost more than half of my initial investment in Bitcoin. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect that Bitcoin skyrocketed 10+ times just 1 year later. Ironically, as I\u0026rsquo;m writing right now Bitcoin price has upped 20 times comparing the time, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna get back on it. Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna put all my stakes on it, but since the production halving is about to happen in 2 months and the global stock market is stumbling, I don\u0026rsquo;t see any other good alternative choice to go.\nIn the end That\u0026rsquo;s all I can recall for this date 4 years ago, I hope I could have some more pleasant memories next time around. Stay tuned. ✊\n"

        "date" : "2020.02.10",
        "body": "Here is the article The Feedback Fallacy Recently I read the article The Feedback Fallacy, I was amazed, I\u0026rsquo;ve thought it for a while, as I was raised in a traditional Asian culture which encourages submissiveness in a patriarchy way, I got a weak ego and incline to follow others whenever possible. But since I left my hometown and living alone in few metro cities for years, I found myself became more self-center, independent, and most importantly, happier. I know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, I know what I want and I\u0026rsquo;m doing my own best in the present, I tend to take rejection more relax, I only worry about letting myself down and lose my hope.\nI tried really hard to find my own passion and proudness. I want to be happy and proud, relax and determined, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard since most of my friends who are Chinese, my family members are still live in collective society, most of personal experience were there as well. I believe the individualism, I\u0026rsquo;d like to record some excerpts to remind myself every once in a while.\nThe Source of Truth The first problem with feedback is that humans are unreliable raters of other humans. Over the past 40 years psychometricians have shown in study after study that people don’t have the objectivity to hold in their heads a stable definition of an abstract quality, such as business acumen or assertiveness, and then accurately evaluate someone else on it. Our evaluations are deeply colored by our own understanding of what we’re rating others on, our own sense of what good looks like for a particular competency, our harshness or leniency as raters, and our own inherent and unconscious biases\nJust as your doctor doesn’t know the truth of your pain, we don’t know the truth about our colleagues, at least not in any objective way\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very hard to feel someone else\u0026rsquo;s feeling, especially when you don\u0026rsquo;t know them or their personal history very well. The same as \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t judge\u0026rdquo;, because it\u0026rsquo;s just hard to tell.\nAnd the third belief is that great performance is universal, analyzable, and describable, and that once defined, it can be transferred from one person to another, regardless of who each individual is.\nFocusing people on their shortcomings doesn\u0026rsquo;t enable learning; it impairs it. This is the “fight or flight” system, which mutes the other parts of the brain and allows us to focus only on the information most necessary to survive. Your brain responds to critical feedback as a threat and narrows its activity\nSometimes I got this bad habit, I feel it\u0026rsquo;s my obligation as a friend (family member) to point out their drawbacks, it\u0026rsquo;s helping them. I\u0026rsquo;ve got lots of pushback, and I got confused or hurt lots of times. I should have more patients, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hurt others just because I want to help.\nWe’re often told that the key to learning is to get out of our comfort zones, but these findings contradict that particular chestnut: Take us very far out of our comfort zones, and our brains stop paying attention to anything other than surviving the experience. It’s clear that we learn most in our comfort zones, because that’s where our neural pathways are most concentrated. It’s where we’re most open to possibility, most creative, insightful, and productive\nThis part shocked me, it\u0026rsquo;s so true. Looking back my own history, I did feel very excited about stepping out my comfort zone and gaining new experience/skills, but it was only true when I knew what I was doing, I knew what was wanting. It would be a huge pain dragging or pushing by others out of my own comfort zone, maybe few times I made it, I do appreciate those \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo;, but I\u0026rsquo;m very sure lots of times those \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo; are just in vain and introduced struggle.\nExcellence Excellence is idiosyncratic\nExcellence is also not the opposite of failure. If you study failure, you’ll learn a lot about failure but nothing about how to achieve excellence. Excellence has its own pattern.\nHow to Help myself Excel Everyone\u0026rsquo;s current status is the summation of his personal experience and family(raised situation) background or other random facts.\nrandom Instead of asking and listening from others, why don\u0026rsquo;t we dedicate some time (customize a habit would be the best) to listen from ourselves, of course, you can get self bias\n"

        "body": "How it started I didn\u0026rsquo;t know there is a thing called \u0026ldquo;communication styles\u0026rdquo; until I started preparing a Toastmaster speech and I took the quiz, I got 5/12 in Supportive style, 4/12 in Direct style, 2/12 in initiating, 1/12 in analytical. So Supportive and Direct are my dominant communication styles.\nIt does make sense as much as I know myself, actually they\u0026rsquo;re pretty much aligned with how I interact with other people in general, I\u0026rsquo;m glad that they\u0026rsquo;re aligned. I\u0026rsquo;m a combination of supportive(shy, indecisive, slow, risk-averse) and Direct(confident, competitive, independent, and risk-taking). Some people might be wondering, how could these two be reconciled in one person? Well, let me explain.\nSupportive Style First the supportive style, in another word as myself noticed, lacking of leadership and initiative. I\u0026rsquo;m a passionate person in general, I like to talk and engage with others in the area I\u0026rsquo;m interested in, for example, stock market, programming, psychology etc. But I rarely initialize any conversation or activity I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about, instead, I would listen to the people around me, and choose whether I should follow. I make my preference and lifestyle quite supple and diverse so I can be quite adaptive with different people, it\u0026rsquo;s not easy for me to not have a good time.\nFor example, these days I go to rock climbing twice a week with my roommate Eric because he is kinda passionate about it, he has been doing it since he was a teen, and he is quite good at it. I learned a lot from him, I do enjoy it, I invested a lot of time and energy in it, I can see myself doing it in foreseeable future, but I would probably won\u0026rsquo;t start without him.\nI started semi-serious body building workout because then roommate Bimal was passionate about body building, he has got a quite physique, I was influenced by him, I used to go to gym with him 3 times a week while I was in Charlotte, now I moved out but kept the workout routine by myself.\nWhen I was working in office (before pandemic), my co-worker sitting next to me Jeremy was so passionate about playing Table Tennis, I was influenced by him, I ended up investing lots of time and energy in playing Pingpong with him.\nThe list could go on and on throughout my life, I like to hang out with passionate person, and I do enjoy being a supportive follower. I do hope one day I could stand up in the limelight and be the leader/influencer and get some followers.\nDirect style Well, there is another side of me, the \u0026ldquo;direct\u0026rdquo; me, and I often being called blunt for it. And I\u0026rsquo;m Okay with it, it\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to mince words when the hard cold true is in front of my face. I am an empathetic person, it\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t feel for others, but my preferred way of handling conflict/confusing/mystery is facing it head on, some people might not like it, and I probably can adjust accordingly when I notice, but that\u0026rsquo;s not easy or natural for me.\nFor example, last time in a party one of my friend Bishal approached me and asked a question which he\u0026rsquo;s asked me many times, \u0026ldquo;Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin?\u0026rdquo; I replied without thinking for a second: \u0026ldquo;Yes, of course it\u0026rsquo;s a good time, nobody can really time the market, so anytime is a good time! And don\u0026rsquo;t ask me the same question, please!\u0026rdquo; He said \u0026ldquo;Okay\u0026rdquo; and walked away, I knew he was a bit offended or disappointed, and I\u0026rsquo;m Okay with it, I wanted to let him know I don\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nYes, I literally told him \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t ask me the same question\u0026rdquo;, which some people might frown upon on this \u0026ldquo;rudeness\u0026rdquo;. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t being rude but just direct in my own view.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not hard to tell when would I being \u0026ldquo;direct\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s when things/topics fall into my passionate area, things/topics I\u0026rsquo;ve invested a lot.\nSometimes I found myself very opinionated on some ideas, for example, I like CLI tools a lot, Vim is the best editor, I believe in Bitcoin, crypto and Blockchain etc. When things/ideas fall into the very limited area which I\u0026rsquo;ve invested a lot in, I became confident, emboldened and direct.\nIn the end There you have it, for things are not in my specialty or passionate area, I tend to supportive. For things I have confidence or invested heavily in, I tend to be direct.\n"

I saw a lot of elation in my Twitter timeline, it seems a lot of people dislike Facebook, it makes me sad. I was never a big fan of Facebook, or social network in that regard, but I do feel its service gives us more good than harm (not like those Twitter celebrities say the best FB can do is like this shut down its service, ofc I\u0026rsquo;m paraphrasing).\nWalled Garden I first heard people expressed disgust towards Facebook was John Gruber in his talkshow, his main idea was that FB stands the opposite side of open web, it purposefully blocks any crawler, search engines can\u0026rsquo;t index any content inside Facebook, thus it buidls a walled garden, and keep customers in its ecosystem.\nOf course I don\u0026rsquo;t like that, nobody like being constrainted to a for-profit company\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem, the more we being constrained to a company, the more we could lose, not matter how good service or product they provide. But it\u0026rsquo;s not an uncommon practice for business. Like Apple for instance, they are also trying really hard to limit its customers in their Apple only ecosystem. So does Google, though we feel like we hop on and off in Google search like a breeze, but we can\u0026rsquo;t help but coming back to google all the time, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a secret they put their own service in front page of search result.\nI guess most people have a natural distaste towards Facebook\u0026rsquo;s social network monopoly, almost everybody knows monopoly is bad, it was uncanny that FB acquired Ins and WhatsApp before they became a threat, and so FTC could approve its acquisition. I\u0026rsquo;m still glad we have Snapchat, Twitter and other small services as alternatives.\nCensorship It\u0026rsquo;s not doubt contents from its platform as \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; as from China media, no brutality, porn or hate etc, very much family friendly, though you can still criticize government or public policy in any kind. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been a fan of censorship, I enojy stumble on explicit photo/vidoes or porn in Twitter every now and then, but I think the modernation is mild and acceptable.\nAddiction Criticizing the addiction of social media has seem to be another kind of PC nowadays. Come on, I\u0026rsquo;m sure people wowuld addict on millions of other things inevitably, it\u0026rsquo;s not FB\u0026rsquo;s fault, the most current one is Tiktok and those short video platforms, I often lost time on it as well.\nIn the end I like the glamorous abundances in Instagram, I like the chap affordable items in FB market place, the FB nerborhood feature, the Dating feature etc. I do think they provide me lots of value.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s cynical to say FB don\u0026rsquo;t provide value to our society. I do hope we could break the monopoly FB controls, that would be better for everyone.\n"

Let me clean my thought by write it down.\ndocile \u0026amp; diffidence I first heard this two words phrase from the Video, that\u0026rsquo;s the common stereotype of Japanese girls which lots of people like, yeah, shame to say, I\u0026rsquo;m one of them. I think most probably I grew in a traditional confucian culture, it emphasis stabilization of family as the smallest unit of society is the essence of a good society, and female usually act as a assistant in the family which male adult is the leader. I\u0026rsquo;m very used to it. I do admire the strong ego of modern women, but maybe just because my ego is relative weak, I just feel I\u0026rsquo;m not able to work with that out.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just a traditional Asian adult who hopes I could be the cornerstone of the family(Yeah, in Asian culture, getting married and have children is a must, not an option), my partner would be better admire me, assist me.\nMen usually acts as hard-edged character, but female act malleable other side. I really like girls have the malleable personality.\nSweet smile \u0026amp; love life The same as majority male adult, I like girls have sweet smile and act sweet all the time if possible.\nI like girls who can make life delicate and exquisite. I like those people who try to improve life quality all the time, understand the unspoken rules of life, get along with it that attracts me.\nEmpathy I like girls who have strong empathy, she can understand the subtle feelings, she will be touched easily and comfort others when necessary.\nAfter I wrote this down, I feel my expectations are typically old fashion Asian male way, which is a shame I always profess myself as a progress liberal.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny I myself know myself in the bottom of my heart I naturally have those characters, in many years, I feel like my personality is like a girl, I\u0026rsquo;d definitely willing the date a girl has a copy of my personality. But over the years striving in the society, I got over it, I changed quit a bit on the surface.\nWhat are those characters put me off? Being aggressive Working or living with girls with aggressive personality really put me off, I had few experience, I got lost. But with male on the same situation, I don\u0026rsquo;t that mind, I enjoyed challenge authority and being challenged by others as well, I know this sounds sexism, but it\u0026rsquo;s just another old fashion Asian way.\nanti-intellectual "

I heard Jeff Bezos says \u0026ldquo;Work life harmony\u0026rdquo;, yes, I\u0026rsquo;m totally down with that.\nI got paid constantly with considerable salary It\u0026rsquo;s hard to deny nowadays programmers got paid very generously comparing other professions, the market is booming, lots of opportunities available all the time, it\u0026rsquo;s a good time. The whole society is moving digitalization and we are just started, i know there are would be even more opportunities in the perceivable future, I\u0026rsquo;m moving the same directino with the world. I know I\u0026rsquo;m making positive contribution to the world, I feel safe.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good for my career growth Work environment is my backyard playground where I can play, I got all the good office supplies, product design, UI/UX resources, they\u0026rsquo;re all there support my play, how can i don\u0026rsquo;t feel grateful. I can image myself start my own project which these support (maybe I should find one). I like to work with others, I always learning from people around me.

I committed to the IT revolution.

I guess lots of people are kind of sick of the non-stop notifications coming every few minutes even seconds (Specially some notifications are default to alert instead of preview, it would hover there forever which is super annoying, that\u0026rsquo;s a another story),\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, the notifications are very necessary, we want keep ourselves informed. I knew there is a notification center centralize all notifications, we can check them any time. There is a \u0026ldquo;no disturb\u0026rdquo; toggle we can turn on, so there is no notification popping out any more, they all end up collecting in notification center anyway which is nice. But my notification center always end up thousands of feeds which I never checked regularly, it keeps overrun all the time, I never really read any of them, just blindly delete all.\nWhy it ends like this? I only found it out when I explored the shortcut of \u0026ldquo;no disturb mode\u0026rdquo;, just Press and hold the Option key while you click the Notification Center icon in the menu bar, that\u0026rsquo;s fantastic easy. Then I realize how the redundant steps stopped me from clicking the toggle, click the menu icon and wait the animation of notification swiping out, then move to the toggle and click and swept it out, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look very complicate, but it do require some context change, some move around, the animation I\u0026rsquo;d say even worse the experience tho it only takes less than 1 second.\nThen I started using the notification center because opt in the no disturb mode which makes me not able to receive any pop up notification. I had to check the center to know what\u0026rsquo;s going on, after I checked, I would clean them conveniently. The problem solved and the new habit customized.\neverything has its inertia\nIt reminds why we need a Killer feature to migrate habit, because the migration expense is big, but the ground work is needed to\n"

The difference is they tell story in a funny way, sarcastic, exaggerating or just make some funny analogy.\nPassion, enthusiasm with love Why I feel their love? Because they\u0026rsquo;re focusing, they find a direction, a crack in life they can make it better, as consumers we don\u0026rsquo;t have to use them, they have no right to enforce us. We use them because we like it, we feel the significant different. Let\u0026rsquo;s say Facebook, we can\u0026rsquo;t say Facebook is producing with Love, because it\u0026rsquo;s so big, it\u0026rsquo;s in dominant position in our modern social world, it\u0026rsquo;s not a choice any more, it just got so much liability.\nMake everybody happy is just impractical, the more you need to cover, the more liability and criticism you got, we can see from any democratic politician.\nI like relative small product, they can focus, solve problem just like a small percentage of person like me. The more deep the focus, more they reach to my heart, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of impossible, but if they can provide high enough customization, I will can\u0026rsquo;t hold myself from digging into and customize for myself, eventually I will integrate myself fully with the tool, the tool became part of me, that\u0026rsquo;s the end game.\nLove is influencial, it can spread, influence\nLove is subjective, so does happy,\nBe happy, know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, spread the love\n"

        "body": "The taste of freedom People always saying the United States of America is a free country, but what does it mean \u0026ldquo;Free\u0026rdquo;, as I grew up in China and have lived here for 3+ years, I have some feelings of the freedom.\nFreedom of press There are just tons of rumors and disinformation pumping out every second in the country. I think that\u0026rsquo;s just a side effect of free of expression. Spreading disinformation as individuals is free of punishment, because you can\u0026rsquo;t tell before it has been verify (lots of times), people tend to believe what they already believed, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of self self-reinforce cycle.\nThe world is complicate, there isn\u0026rsquo;t black-and-white truth most of time, everybody sees the side of the truth, the press tend to give side of truth because people like to watch what they\u0026rsquo;ve believed, if media takes no stands, no conclusion, very objective and unbiased, that would be very boring and not informative.\nFree of fear I\u0026rsquo;ve watched numerous times of this video free video, people can only be free when the government is constrained. Theoretically we can do anything we can as long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t violate the law, we need to learn the rules (laws), the law should not change frequently, the law should make sense. We can sue the government anytime if we don\u0026rsquo;t agree. Protect the vulnerable is part of humanitarian but also for ourselves, because any of us can get into the dark side. We protect them is also protect ourselves (Is that part of empathy?).\nFree of meaningless traditions interesting video here as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVAhr4hZDJE\nI only started know the \u0026ldquo;Procedural justice\u0026rdquo; til I arrived in the US. there are so many example of it, if the police doesn\u0026rsquo;t have decent evident of I did things wrong, they can\u0026rsquo;t interrogate me or ask anything from me, I have the right not to fear about that as long as I do things decently. There is no such thing in China I would say.\nLots of people live in US they don\u0026rsquo;t trust the government, neither the press. They trust their own judgement, they protect their own rights to bear guns.\nThe Amish life I was astonished there are more than 200K+ Amish people living in the US, they don\u0026rsquo;t believe any modern techniques, most of them don\u0026rsquo;t speak English, they live the medieval lifestyle.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t understand that choice, as I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the vegetarian lifestyle if not for environment purpose. But people has the right to live whatever kind of lifestyle they want, happy is subjective, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to harmony with the modern society.\nFreedom of religion Fa lun gong "

        "body": "Don\u0026rsquo;t get strapped by rules Recently just few months ago I started riding motorcycle, I knew it was pretty scary riding bike in this grueling Bay Area, but I knew I gonna love it, it was so much fun hitting on the road in a fast speed without a iron wrapper enclosed, I can feel the wind and road. As a beginner, I need to practice a lot to get use to ride on the two wheels, and the best and most difficult motorcycle practicing place is mountain road, luckily, there is a curvy mountain road close to my house. I went there practicing cornering a lot, there was a problem bothered me so much, there were few times I felt I almost lost control of my bike. Because whenever there is a big turn, or complicate road condition, the speed limit would change, specially in the mountain road, the speed limit change a lot. As a newbie rider, it nerves me a lot to adjust my speed base on the guidepost. Some day all of sudden, I realized I should let me self be the judge of my safety and comfort. There are so many factors affect the safety speed, like visibility, humidity, pavement condition, wind power and direction, gradient, and my general body status etc. I could start it slow, but I should get the ability to blend all those factors I could aware and let myself know is my current speed comfort or not.\nThe most scary moment is to making a big turn in a mountain road, because in order to make a turn for motorcycle, you have to push the handle bar in the same direction you are turning to in order to make yourself lean to direction you want and make the bike go that way, the technical term is counter steering. It\u0026rsquo;s counter-intuitive and hard.\nI was so nervous and uncomfortable about it, besides the leaning during the turn, I had to constant check my current speed and the road limit speed on the guidepost. Then someday all of a sudden I realized I should not check the speed, I should let me main focus on the road, there are so many factors affect my safety speed, like the road visibility, the wind speed, the humidity, my pavement condition and my body condition etc. After I\u0026rsquo;ve practiced tons of miles, myself on the road should be center judge for what\u0026rsquo;s the safe and comfort speed for me, I should have a general feeling of what\u0026rsquo;s safe for myself. Since then, I felt much more fun and comfort on the road, all my focus on the road, I gather all the road condition naturally through my body sensor and tell myself how is it, I might ease off during the turn or speed up, or consistent changing as I felt good, I got instant response of trial base on the my true feeling, I might hit on the same turn everyday in different speed, you know what, I never check and I don\u0026rsquo;t care. Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m not a crazy guy, I probably over speed every time but it can\u0026rsquo;t be too much. Regardless, I only got the 300 cc bike.\nThis reminds me of the English learning experience, I spent 10s of years leaning English grammar, the past tense, perfect tense and future tense and all the appropriate adjective. I never enjoyed it, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn well to be honest. After lots of trials, I notice just speak out and get some awkward or embarrassment would be the best for me to learn those tedious nuance, like those tense ,grammar or appropriate words. That\u0026rsquo;s why I come here, I hope to learn English and public speaking ability with you guys together.\n"

I was kind of dancing with between that\nI love being inspired I like being inspired, reading a life story of others always let me think about what if there is another path of my life, let me get some knowledge of life choice, life is about making choices, any of use can\u0026rsquo;t experience everything, we can learn from others\u0026rsquo; life story and make a best one for ourselves.\nI love profanity words God damn, I really love it. Those profanity words light me fighting will, those words are kind of like provoking, offenseing, anyone can be offsensed by any of those words and start a fight, and let\u0026rsquo;s have a fight. It\u0026rsquo;s like an art, you are alright to use some words in some situation but sometimes you got scewed for different people of different situation, it\u0026rsquo;s like playing at the brink of dangerous, it\u0026rsquo;s so fun.\nEven though I\u0026rsquo;m a really mild person, but I do enjoy this kind of risk, maybe I do like a fight as well.\n"

        "body": "To be an adventurist Intrigue I have been reading the book \u0026ldquo;Principle\u0026rdquo; written by Ray Dalio for few months, I really like this guy and the way he thinks about things. There is one excerpt impressed me, Ray sent his then 11 yo son Matt to China for one year, when the time China didn\u0026rsquo;t even have unlimited hot water at night, Ray likes China, he thought China has a huge potential, he wanted to have some connection with China, of course he provided his son with safety and basic needs. Somebody might think that\u0026rsquo;s selfish or cruel, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s a brilliant idea. I grew up in China and just moved to US few years ago, living in total different society and culture really teaches me a lot, I can\u0026rsquo;t help thinking what if I could\u0026rsquo;ve lived in a totally different culture for few years besides China, that would be interesting and inspiring, for example, Japan, yeah, I might send my kid to Japan for 1 or 2 years if I could have the chance. This excerpt reminds me Jeff Bezos once mentioned in an interview, \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;d rather his kids lost one figure but being resourceful\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s why he gave his kids to use knife when they were really young. I think that\u0026rsquo;s bold, and I like it.\nLooking back my own experience I\u0026rsquo;ve played roller skating for years, I enjoyed it. This sport was very popular in China, special between kids and teenagers. For people really seriously play, there are two paths to level up. One is freestyle slalom which play tricks around some small cones, it requires tons of skills and practices, those tricks are amazing, some of them might look unbelievable which usually make audience dazzled. Another path is freestyle braking or sliding, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know the technical term. This one is just braking abruptly with some freestyle tricks while you\u0026rsquo;re in a high speed. It\u0026rsquo;s more like stunt, the tricks in freestyle braking usually makes bystanders feel nervous or breathtaking instead of excited. Because bad luck and happens the player can get insured severely, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a friend broke his hand just in front of me. And I chose this path. I liked it so much, I specially enjoy the breathtaking moment, you either nail it or screw it, it\u0026rsquo;s very simple format in those stunts, but it requires a strong determination while you stick on it. I spent most majority time playing the freestyle braking, I\u0026rsquo;ve fell thousands of times, luckily I haven\u0026rsquo;t got hurt seriously yet.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m doing now I\u0026rsquo;ve always asked myself, what do I really enjoy while doing those tricks while taking the risk. Well, first of all, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that risk is totally out of my control, actually we can control most majority part more than normal people think, and there is a huge maneuverable gap between fall alright vs fall unprotected, just outsider can\u0026rsquo;t grasp the split second.\nI treated this kind of exercise as practice of my willpower and focus ability. I think part of reason is this just part of my nature, like dogs needs run out every day to have some exercise which make them happy, I need to take some risk, solve some uncertainty to let me release some adrenaline, let me feel alive.\nThe same as I was riding motorcycle on commute before the pandemic happens, I really enjoyed the adrenaline spike on the motorcycle. Unlike driving a car which usually pretty relax, hitting a freeway with motorcycle is very much like an adventure. You\u0026rsquo;re the most vulnerable object on the road, you gotta to be serious, you gotta to be aggressive because you are often got ignored which can be catastrophic.\nLooking forward As these kind of exercise or sports they are just my personal plays, I\u0026rsquo;d like to have meaningful fight in adventure in the real world, hopefully benefit the society. How am I gonna do that, well, I think the best for me would be either pioneer an new area or project in a stable company like Walmart or ideally start my own business. As an engineer, I like to solve problem, special solve problem in a engineering way, there are so many problems in our society, I\u0026rsquo;d like to help people kill a few if I have a chance. As one wish Ray Dalio in the book \u0026ldquo;Principle\u0026rdquo; have mentioned, \u0026ldquo;I hope you struggle well\u0026rdquo;, yeah, look back my life experience, I made most of friends during work, most of my enjoyable moments through work on difficult project in difficult times, either I made it or I failed, I become stronger than before. I will try to myself more meaningful struggle and fight them through.\nThanks you!\n"

But living in this country having so-called freedom of expression, I have every right to express my random opinion, I just want to write something down to help myself to understand things and improve my English writing ability incidentally.\nHe just enjoys fighting I feel him, because I\u0026rsquo;m like him in that perspective (I don\u0026rsquo;t like him in any way for sure 😅), I enjoy challenging and being challenged by others, I enjoy the thrilling of fighting, in any fashion, it makes feel alive.\nIn this case, it was triggered by the Chinese foreign minister spokesman brought the idea that the coronavirous might come from the US, it surprised lots of people for sure. Since the notorious swept across the globe, everybody is suffering, the most discouraging thing is we don\u0026rsquo;t know when and how it would be ends, looks like the global economy is in the brink. But one things is for sure for every reasonable and well-informed person, it\u0026rsquo;s come from China, Wuhan specifically. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense throw the bullshit to the US as foreign minister spokesman. In my opinion, Trump or his team has the right to be ruffled, so he just grab this opportunity and start a fight.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure others, as for me, I really hate the feeling of shooting in the dark. I enjoy the feeling of focus and having clear direction. The virus is so new and there are so much mysterious which depresses us, in this well-tensioned moment, get a target to fight is more fun then just do nothing. I can image the US gov exec already hold grudge on the Chinese government about the information transparency. It\u0026rsquo;s like you\u0026rsquo;re holding some grudge on another person and he started the fight accidentally, well, good timing, let\u0026rsquo;s get fire burn.\nOf course I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of keeping saying \u0026ldquo;Chinese Virus\u0026rdquo;, it would definitely bring lots of racism chaos, and most of all, the Chinese people has nothing to do with it. I can\u0026rsquo;t help thinking what would Obama say in this kind of scenario, I think he would handle it in a very political way, give a well-thought speech, nobody get hurt, maybe even including the culprit. I remember there is joke \u0026ldquo;Speaking like Obama\u0026rdquo;, saying people speak too slick which is trick and powerless, like a typical politician maybe. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I like Obama a lot, I got inspired by his speech a lot. I just understand if you want to bring an opinion, a good chance you\u0026rsquo;d ruffle someone, Trump just chose the outrageous and relentless approach, and he was always acting like that, does anybody really surprise? His supporters like his stuboorn, sinceer or \u0026hellip;\nTo distract attention "

Shit, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen numerous news about those Chinese guys\nThey have the basic trust in Government and news media It\u0026rsquo; quite ironic people in China they trust and rely on government so much, but every time any dire situation happens, they got in panic very fast and started looking all kinds of rumors. I think at bottom of their heart, they know how government works, they know their dear gov might sacrifice some one but just don\u0026rsquo;t know who will be, they can\u0026rsquo;t blindly depend on them. They\u0026rsquo;d better prepare something for themselves, looking for grapevines in case gov won\u0026rsquo;t disclose truth, stocking up for family in case shops can\u0026rsquo;t meet the supply.\nOn the contrary, Americans always criticizing the gov, they always saying the gov is not worth truasting, the gov is very inefficient, the news media all full of fake news. But as the situation getting worse, I don\u0026rsquo;t see the normal Americans panic, they live their life as normal, even though gov and news media keep escalating the warnings, nobody can force them putting masks on their face.\nThey have strong mind There is no doubt in general Western people have stronger mind comparing with Asians. As people feel strong and value the independence, they are just not easy to get panic. As stereotype shows, most Asian have weak ego, submissive personality, like sheeps are easy to get panic and lost their mind.\nThey didn\u0026rsquo;t experience that many hard-times as we do Maybe because of history experience, special my parents\u0026rsquo; generation, they have been through many artificial difficulties (disasters), so many of their fellow have been sacrificed, or their social positions been through roller coasters. Like people have been bite by a snake, they would be much easier get scared by ropes.\nIn America, people\u0026rsquo;s life style has been constant for decades, they have the fundamental trust in their society.\n"

Specially things like culture, religion or belief etc, those topics are too big for us as nonprofessional to talk about. But as daily trial random things, well, some of them could also be bound with years of life experience.\nBut my point is we try to be as objective as we can, put our ego aside. I hate to discuss about anything with people who think their thoughts are absolutely right, anybody challenge their way of thinking is challenging themselves. Yeah, sounds weird, but lots of people do this way, even including myself sometimes. I think that\u0026rsquo;s fine for something, like belief etc, those things are just so ingrained, they\u0026rsquo;re so hard to pull out of ourselves, actually they\u0026rsquo;ve become part of ourselves. I believe we should be proud, happy or at least accept those things ingrained to ourselves, they\u0026rsquo;re part of ourselves. But lots of things are not, like people you like, political views you believe, they probably just gonna stay with you for days or years let\u0026rsquo;s say.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell sometimes, because everything I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced, I believe, I like or hate made myself. But the rule of thumb is don\u0026rsquo;t let ego become obstacle of your thinking. I like the idea from Ray Dalio, to stay \u0026ldquo;radical open\u0026rdquo;, everything I believe are absolutely right could be wrong in some case.\nEasy to lose their temper I hate to discuss with people about something then all of sudden he lost his temper, I guess most of people feel the same. I always wonder why all of sudden those people lost their temper, I think either they\u0026rsquo;re not used to be challenged or they become desperate when they can\u0026rsquo;t convince the counterpart or they found they\u0026rsquo;ve wasted too much time on the topics don\u0026rsquo;t matter, these are the scenarios I could image or understand, there are could tons of reasons various by person which I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. Sometimes I also lost my temper because people behavior total out of my expectation, so I need to learn to get myself mentally prepared.\nAt the end of day, I\u0026rsquo;m also a human, even though I\u0026rsquo;m super rational, I could be ruffled by confusing or surprising sometimes. I try not to, I try to understand people, as long as I understand those behavior, I got my mentally prepared, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to forcefully sell my ideas, I won\u0026rsquo;t get myself in desperate, I should be fine. At the end of day, I\u0026rsquo;m not suppose to change anybody\u0026rsquo;s idea, talk or interact with others all just for myself improving and having fun, I want to be relax and enjoy along the way.\nBut I can\u0026rsquo;t change people\u0026rsquo;s way of doing things, and some people\u0026rsquo;s radical behavior could obviously affect my mood, in one party, I should try to learn and understand those people or behavior, in other hand, I should learn to let it go, there are so many things or people in the world I could never understand, I\u0026rsquo;m not a god, just let it go and leave my normal happy life.\n"

        "body": "Adrian is my role model I\u0026rsquo;ve worked a handful of companies and numerous developers, Adrian is the dev who made the biggest impression on me, I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful I had the chance working with him closely. I deeply believe that I\u0026rsquo;m a good developer, but he is great, as the future I can forsee I hope I can become as great as him.\nWork hard and get reward not only influencer, he is shaper he reads super fast\nHe works super hard\nHe is avid TDD advocate, I had a hard time reading his code, that\u0026rsquo;s so many layers of abstraction, but eventually I was totally bought about the idea of TDD and lots of ideas.\nIn a period of time, he literal brought a new idea or tools every morning about how to improve our process or tools he was amazed, I was wondering don\u0026rsquo;t you every rest.\nWork environment is like his playground, he is kind of having fun playing on it.\nHave fun during the journey He got so many quotes\nIf I don\u0026rsquo;t break anything, I don\u0026rsquo;t learn anything fail fast, fail early I only do things I feel cool Be the man make things happen I\u0026rsquo;m a rude person He doesn\u0026rsquo;t accept my apology\nI do everything\nSuperstar, shining He was promoted as mobile architect while I was on PTO in China during Sprint festival, I don\u0026rsquo;t anybody would have any opposed idea about that. He was like a super star not only in the team, in the whole company I\u0026rsquo;d say. He rebuild lots of project which he thought not working well, like the mobile release process(using CI to create release page, automatic tracking everything), Jira management, metric analyze etc, almost like every field he gets involved, he becomes an expert.\nHe talks a lot, I mean really a lot, I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a programmer as social as him, to be honest, he is really good at speaking, throwing jokes. But he also does lot of things, he gets himself into most of the projects(Hiring, interviewing, coding, QA, process management etc), but most of his coding time was at home after work hours, because there are so many people keep coming to here asking his advice, he was like a shining star, I can tell he was frustrating but also enjoying it. On a sharp contrary, I was siting right besides him, but nobody come to me.\n"

        "body": "Great speech! You greatly reduced your filling words! Suggestions would be trying to act like an actor or animation figure some time. This is exactly the same thing I got from Tasha for my vocal variety speech\nBody language In what ways can body language express emotion? Why is eye contact with your audience an important part of your speech? How can facial expressions enhance the content of your message? Why is too much body movement distracting for an audience? Why is it important to be aware of cultural differences in the use of body language?\nBody language is the nonverbal expression of emotions, feelings, and ideas. Your posture, movement, position, gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions all contribute to the message you send when you speak. Your body language can enhance your communication or undermine your message.\nposture, stance, position, movement\ndescriptive gesture emphatic gesture suggestive gesture\nprompting gesture\nFace expression Gesture body movement Intentionally, unintentionally How do I stay sane in this over-abundant world Hello fellow toastmasters, today we are gonna talk about sanity and over-abundance.\nRaise your hand if you feel overwhelmed by excessive notification everyday, raise your hand if your todo list keeps piling up, how about read later list? And checkout list etc etc. I see some hands there. Trust me, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone, this is a common problems, and we all go through them together.\nThe [[frustration]] of not able to get things done, the [[ temptation ]] of checking what\u0026rsquo;s going on out there in internet, or how my friends doing in social media.\nHere 3 tips I\u0026rsquo;d like to share today, 1. Be selective 2. Do things thematically 3. Letting them go.\nBe selective First, be selective, by treating things different in priority and time. For example, most content we consume everyday they\u0026rsquo;re just news, and they\u0026rsquo;re most probably one-sided arguments, before dust settle down, they all subjected to change. I subscribed lots of newsletter in email and lots of channel in Youtube, I try to read news in fast speed, most just skimming, grabbing the headline and keywords. If there are infomation I missed, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, they would come back to my ears in another way most probably. Same applies to videos or podcast, I usually do fast speed 1.5x or even 2x. This makes my information consuming way more intense and fulfilling, ofc it takes some practice in order to make you feel well.\nDo things thematically For those timeless knowledge and insight, I\u0026rsquo;ve got more time to consume them carefully, thoroughly and repeatedly. I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to build my own personal knowledge management system, aka \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo;, I dump all those resources I need to review and explore inside by tagging.\nThis leads to my 2nd tips, do thing thematically. Whenever I want to learn something, I try to pull multiple resources either on internet or from my second brain, books, blog posts, videos from multiple people, most of the time their ideas are quite similar, if not the same, ofc there are a lot of nuance, and different interpretation, that\u0026rsquo;s the fun part, I can compare them back and forth, I found this way to learn is way easier, I can read way faster, I can understand way deeper.\nLetting it go The last one is letting it go. There is no shortcut for achieving anything meaningful or worth persuing. You can\u0026rsquo;t get ripped without working out everyday, you can\u0026rsquo;t get rich without working your tail off, you can\nInfatuation\nget ripped stock market guru Any sports\nFOMO\nlet the desire go, let the unrealist infatuation go.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t fall to the consumerism trap,\nThere is no shortcut,\nNo breaking news, the sky is not falling, no need to be connected 24/7\n"
