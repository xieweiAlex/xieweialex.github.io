<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on politics, actually on the contrary, I&rsquo;ve very limited knowledge about politics, since I&rsquo;ve just lived in the US for 3 years, I&rsquo;m very amazed by the abundance of politic news and it really interact with our daily life which not a thing in China. But living in this country having so-called freedom of expression, I have every right to express my random opinion, I just want to write something down to help myself to understand things and improve my English writing ability incidentally.</p>
<h3 id="he-just-enjoys-fighting">He just enjoys fighting</h3>
<p>I feel him, because I&rsquo;m like him in that perspective (I don&rsquo;t like him in any way for sure 😅), I enjoy challenging and being challenged by others, I enjoy the thrilling of fighting, in any fashion, it makes feel alive.</p>
<p>In this case, it was triggered by the Chinese foreign minister spokesman brought the idea that the coronavirous might come from the US, it surprised lots of people for sure. Since the notorious swept across the globe, everybody is suffering, the most discouraging thing is we don&rsquo;t know when and how it would be ends, looks like the global economy is in the brink. But one things is for sure for every reasonable and well-informed person, it&rsquo;s come from China, Wuhan specifically. It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense throw the bullshit to the US as foreign minister spokesman. In my opinion, Trump or his team has the right to be ruffled, so he just grab this opportunity and start a fight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure others, as for me, I really hate the feeling of shooting in the dark. I enjoy the feeling of focus and having clear direction. The virus is so new and there are so much mysterious which depresses us, in this well-tensioned moment, get a target to fight is more fun then just do nothing. I can image the US gov exec already hold grudge on the Chinese government about the information transparency. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re holding some grudge on another person and he started the fight accidentally, well, good timing, let&rsquo;s get fire burn.</p>
<p>Of course I don&rsquo;t like the idea of keeping saying &ldquo;Chinese Virus&rdquo;, it would definitely bring lots of racism chaos, and most of all, the Chinese people has nothing to do with it. I can&rsquo;t help thinking what would Obama say in this kind of scenario, I think he would handle it in a very political way, give a well-thought speech, nobody get hurt, maybe even including the culprit. I remember there is joke &ldquo;Speaking like Obama&rdquo;, saying people speak too slick which is trick and powerless, like a typical politician maybe. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like Obama a lot, I got inspired by his speech a lot. I just understand if you want to bring an opinion, a good chance you&rsquo;d ruffle someone, Trump just chose the outrageous and relentless approach, and he was always acting like that, does anybody really surprise? His supporters like his stuboorn, sinceer or &hellip;</p>
