<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing skateboard for over a year now, the more I learned it, the more I like it. As I&rsquo;m getting old, I&rsquo;d like settle for some hobbies not only for transitory entertainment, but also feed my soul, I can find kindred community, and I can see myself sticking with it for years.</p>
<h3 id="its-challenging-and-inspiring">It&rsquo;s challenging and inspiring</h3>
<p>There is nothing short of inspirational skateboarding videos in internet, either 10 feet deep bowl deep dive or 24 staircases jumping over, I don&rsquo;t see myself could ever even do it for my life, I don&rsquo;t want get myself killed for this &ldquo;bold&rdquo; challenges, but who knows, I&rsquo;m just starting out, I will get more confidence, maybe one day I would get boasted to try. That&rsquo;s very interesting to think about it.</p>
<p>Actually I highly underestimated the difficulty of skateboarding, I played roller skating for many years, I was good at that, I thought I would ramp up like a breeze, I failed ðŸ˜…. I spent months just to be able Ollie on a still flat ground, and I still haven&rsquo;t master it, it&rsquo;s a shame. It&rsquo;s a fundamental trick I know, as I heard people saying some people can learn Ollie in a week, lots of people can not learn it in life time. And there is tons of other medium and advanced tricks to learn. I won&rsquo;t get bored for many years at least.</p>

<h3 id="kindred-community">Kindred community</h3>
<p>One part I like skateboarding because it&rsquo;s kinda dangerous, you can get your body scratched, your ankle, legs broken for a bad luck, easier. It&rsquo;s not for a faint of heart. There are numerous skateboard tricks circulating in internet, which are too bold, some people might despise their boldness, some might get aspired, I&rsquo;m the latter. I don&rsquo;t see myself can master those tricks anytime soon, but even just imaging one day I could do that already makes me excited.</p>
<p>The general stereotype of skateboarders are grassroots, rebellious, cantankerous, I like it, it&rsquo;s similar with people riding sport motorcycle, that makes me feel cool ðŸ˜Ž.</p>
<h3 id="its-convenient--affordable">It&rsquo;s convenient &amp; affordable</h3>
<p>I loved playing basketball when I was a teen, it&rsquo;s convenient, sophisticated and fun. But after I stopped growing vertically, and being short in height is such a disadvantage for playing basketball. I&rsquo;m very unhappy about it. I know that&rsquo;s not anybody&rsquo;s fault, I opted out despondently.</p>
<p>Recently there is a fad that lots of people fascinating into skiing or snowboarding, I&rsquo;ve always liked those balance required sport, especially snowboarding, it looks cool and I can play some tricks with it. I went to play a couple of times, and I found out it&rsquo;s not very good for me to take it seriously.</p>
<p>In most of area you can only play snowboard couple of months in a year, all base on the lenient of weather. Usually you have to drive couple of hours to the snow field, since it is not convenient to get there, people usually play many hours non stop from mountain top to bottom, I usually get bored playing 1 or 2 hours.</p>
<p>To me, playing snowboarding is more like a social sport, a group of people hitting there and play together is a typical theme. As I&rsquo;m not a social person(I&rsquo;m not anti-social in any means), one of the reason I loved basketball is I can play myself all alone and enjoy it, which you just can&rsquo;t do it in football, pingpong or tennis. I would expect the sports (or anything) I like, I spent most of time I&rsquo;m progressing myself alone, and some occasional chances we hit up some friends sparking ideas together.</p>
<p>One thing I like about skateboard is it doesn&rsquo;t require anything besides a board and willing. You can play in most of place you want, there isn&rsquo;t much cost or maintenance(I&rsquo;ve been tormenting my board for over a year, the maintenance is $0).</p>
