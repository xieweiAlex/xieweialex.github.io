<h3 id="animal-person">Animal Person</h3>
<p>I love animals without a doubt, I follow cute animal public accounts in any social media whatever I use, like Instagram, Twitter, FB or Wechat. I feel genuinely happy when I see cute animals, &ldquo;Thedodo&rdquo; is one of my favorite public account. I like both cats üê± and dogs üê∂. Though I feel cat is more cute in general(I spent more time on cat photos and videos), but I like dog the most, I admire and appreciate those natural traits from dogs, like loyalty, braveness and optimism. One of my ideal house would be having a small farm in backyard, I can grow some vegetables along with some animals.</p>
<h3 id="i-like-sports">I like Sports</h3>
<p>Looking back my grow up history, I liked a handful of sports. Doing exercise makes me excited and happy in general, and I always get friends while doing sport. I spent a big amount of teenage time playing basketball, I loved it. I played roller skating for years, then years of roller blading in college. I met my first girlfriend while playing roller skate in college. After college, I started like jogging regularly, most of time after sunset while listening podcast. Recently started late 2019, I started doing weight lifting(or muscle building), skateboarding and motorcycling (I consider riding motorcycle is a sport üò∫)</p>
<h3 id="ambivert">Ambivert</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an introvert person for sure, I can and willing to express my feeling and affection anytime needed. I talk a lot when with people or topic I&rsquo;m interested in, I believe communication is the key üîë for lots of problems. I like to exert my influence/endeavor to make things becoming better. But I don&rsquo;t have many friends social life, I&rsquo;m not a fan of gathering or party, social events drain my energy significantly. I rarely contact any of my friends which I know I should do more.</p>
<h3 id="open-minded">Open-minded</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m very open-minded and adaptive, I&rsquo;m a typical progressive liberal in America&rsquo;s political spectrum, I&rsquo;m open to a lots of novel ideas, I often got mind blown by those different ideas, and I enjoy exploring them. I&rsquo;m not a fan of lots of traditions no matter what culture it belongs or how long it has been adherent.</p>
<h3 id="optimist">Optimist</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a natural optimist, I tend to believe things are promising in our life, all the time. I tend to look for changes, make some changes, either physically or mentally, consciously or unconsciously, I believe changes bring to good, making progress with mistakes better than leaving regrets, etc.</p>
<h3 id="radical-rational">radical rational</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a rational personality. I like doing analysis and predictions. I believe our life progress bases on the decisions we make every day, whether big or small. I tend to analysis the world/society around me, I only believe things can be scientific tested. Those zodiac, religion are not my thing.</p>
<h3 id="adventurist">Adventurist</h3>
<p>I enjoy the feeling of risk-taking, it makes me being alive. I enjoy the adrenalin spike while riding motorcycle in open freeway(of course I wear protective gear every time). I enjoy any of those extreme sports, specially those sports require split-second decision making which spikes the adrenalin release. I do those sports to make myself both mentally and physically strong, and I feel happy when I&rsquo;m feeling strong ‚úä.</p>
