    <h3 id="how-it-started">How it started</h3>
<p>I got an internet call(anonymous call) at 11 am, I hesitated a few seconds to answer because most of those calls are just scams, but I took it. It was a female voice saying she is a police officer and my motorcycle is found and it&rsquo;s in Fremont, she wanted me to stop by ASAP. I was like, What??!! üòÆüòÆ  I got ecstatic immediately, my bike has gone missing over 2 weeks, I&rsquo;ve already crossed off my shopping list for my bike. I said I will be there very soon. I grabbed my helmet and gloves and thinking I might be better riding back in local instead of freeway in case it isn&rsquo;t in a good shape, as always, I got too optimistic. üôÇ</p>
<h3 id="on-spot">On spot</h3>
<p>I arrived the industrial area in Fremont, I got a feeling of gang fighting scene from movies. Deserted factories, ragged road, heavy-duty trucks buzzing around and etc. I approached the police car, officer Santana asked me to sign a acceptance paper, I asked &ldquo;Where is my bike?&rdquo;, &ldquo;there it is&rdquo;, she pointed me to a RV. My bike was bonded with an RV with lots bruises on the body. Then I noticed the ignition lock has been ripped off, windshield and left mirror are gone. I definitely CAN NOT ride it home. üò©</p>
<p><img src="../../img/motorcycle-found/bonded-1.jpg" alt="bonded-1"></p>
<p>I started contacting my insurance agent for help, to my surprise, she acted cranky(even cruel I think). She responded &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you? You&rsquo;re not my customer anymore, I&rsquo;m crossing off your name in my customer list&rdquo;, I was like, ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì üòÆ that&rsquo;s unexpected!</p>
<p>I was very inexperienced and helpless and being stranded on the road, I knew my insurance expired (it expired two weeks ago before the bike got stolen which is another bummer), she has all the right not to help me, but I don&rsquo;t really understand why she chose to burn the bridge, she can simply disguise her indifference by providing some empty friendliness, she hung up without giving any excuse, twice!! I was shocked. That&rsquo;s unprofessional! I will try to use my influence (if I have or will have) to talk people away from her service from now on. She sucks! üò°</p>
<p>Then I moved on trying to contact my friend for help, Officer Santana cruised back and told me that she wants me to get the bike out of the scene as soon as possible, she can&rsquo;t leave without knowing my bike is out this spot. Because the person being arrested will be released today and he might come back anytime, she doesn&rsquo;t want me get into trouble. I was like WTH üòÆ! Though it&rsquo;s my bike but I don&rsquo;t want to fight a &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; with his prey. I also felt warm that she came back to inform me, she cared about me, even she doesn&rsquo;t know me at all, comparing with Joana, Officer Santana is so kind. After a few seconds thought, I decided to manual roll the bike to a safer place, I rolled it into a building few blocks away.</p>
<h3 id="towing-options">Towing options</h3>
<p>The next thing is towing it away. I decided not to tow it back home since it requires immediate repair. I contacted a motorcycle transport service, the guy replied me that he just had a motorcycle accident which needs to stay in bed for 1-2 weeks. What? üòÆ I suddenly feel so grateful that I haven&rsquo;t had any motorcycle accident, bike being stolen isn&rsquo;t the worse thing can happen. Then I contacted another motorbike mover, he asked for $125, I agreed. If my insurance is still valid, I could&rsquo;ve saved the money and these hassles.</p>
<p>My phone somehow was wacky the whole day, threw wrenches in my works. i.e. I can not turn on camera taking photo, can not load map while using Google/Apple map. After hours of frustration I realized that I upgraded an iOS Beta version last night, how the helll I would know I&rsquo;d be out for the whole day, and alone. I was so helpless when my phone stopped working, my phone is my everything when I&rsquo;m outside, for phone calls, for maps, for Google search and take pictures etc.</p>
<h3 id="repair-options">Repair options</h3>
<p>After 1 hour drive on the towing car, my bike got into RMC moto, the mechanic gave me the estimate around $1400, my heart sunk. I hoped it could below $1000, I&rsquo;m afraid to spend too much on this bike since I rarely use it, but I still like it, I guess I will go with that.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/motorcycle-found/wait-for-quote.jpg" alt="wait-for-quote"></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Today is Thanksgiving, one of the most important holiday in America, I&rsquo;m very grateful that I got my bike back. I&rsquo;ve always been a careless person, I&rsquo;ve lost many precious stuffs in the past. Every time when bad luck happens, I whisper to myself &ldquo;Come on, give me a second chance, I will be more careful&rdquo;. This is the first time I&rsquo;m given the second chance, Even though I might need to spend thousand of bucks to repair it, the second chance wasn&rsquo;t given for free, I&rsquo;m fine with that. üòá</p>
<p>The stocks I own soared both yesterday and today, I made $4400 (on paper) just today which is the best day since I started investing in stock market, specially the S&amp;P 500 dropped around 0.5%, I feel cool and grateful. I got some money for my harmed bike. And I went out almost a whole day (11 am to 5 pm) I almost didn&rsquo;t do any work today, but nobody complains, I even didn&rsquo;t need to ask permission to leave, I don&rsquo;t take the permissiveness for granted, I thank my teammates/manager and my company. üòá üòò</p>
