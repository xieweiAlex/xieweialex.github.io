      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard I didn&amp;rsquo;t know playing skateboard is that hard until I tried to learn it seriously. I spent couple of months during COVID learning Ollie alone, and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t master it. Ollie is just a starting trick for skateboarding, I got a long way to go. I was very confidence to start since I played roller blade for years which should give me a good balance, which should make my jumpstart easier, I underestimated it.</description>
