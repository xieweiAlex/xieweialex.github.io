      <description>Table of Content What I&amp;rsquo;m thinking Year of visualization What happened Delights Struggle What I&amp;rsquo;m thinking The Meaning of Social I have never been a social person, parties and social gatherings are rarely enjoyable for me, and I struggle to connect with others in those settings.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve grown older, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize the importance of getting out of my friend/work bubble sometimes. It&amp;rsquo;s become clear to me that staying in this routine can be very limiting, especially when I&amp;rsquo;m not satisfied with my current situation (which happens all the time 😏).</description>

      <description>Motivation for writing this I have always enjoyed sharing what I have learned, what excites me, and what I am pondering. However, more often than not, the people around me are not as enthusiastic about these topics as I am.
It is understandable, actually. We live in an information-overloaded world, where everyone has a constant feed of social media. I figured that I could write things down for my own future reference.</description>

      <description>How it started I got an internet call(anonymous call) at 11 am, I hesitated a few seconds to answer because most of those calls are just scams, but I took it. It was a female voice saying she is a police officer and my motorcycle is found and it&amp;rsquo;s in Fremont, she wanted me to stop by ASAP. I was like, What??!! 😮😮 I got ecstatic immediately, my bike has gone missing over 2 weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve already crossed off my shopping list for my bike.</description>
