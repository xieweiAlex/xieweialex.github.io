      <description>Motivation for writing this I have always liked to share &amp;ndash; what I have learned, what excites me and what I&amp;rsquo;m pondering, more often than not, people around me are not jazzed about them.
Which it&amp;rsquo;s understandable actually, we live in an information over-loaded world, everybody has their social media feed constant feeding them. I figured at least I can write them down for my own future reference. If it could help or inspire someone, that&amp;rsquo;s a bonus.</description>

      <description>How it started I got an internet call(anonymous call) at 11 am, I hesitated a few seconds to answer because most of those calls are just scams, but I took it. It was a female voice saying she is a police officer and my motorcycle is found and it&amp;rsquo;s in Fremont, she wanted me to stop by ASAP. I was like, What??!! ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜® I got ecstatic immediately, my bike has gone missing over 2 weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve already crossed off my shopping list for my bike.</description>
