        "body": "As a lifetime learner turned 30, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot during the self-exploratory journey. I\u0026rsquo;ve found some principles work for me very well, I\u0026rsquo;d like to write them down publicly, let the sunlight be the disinfectant.\nEmbrace English I can\u0026rsquo;t emphasize enough the importance of English since I live in a country where English is the official language, and I work in an industry where English is the dominant language. General English skills (read, speak, write) could become a bottleneck for the foreseeable years to come. (That takes time, I know that, but I hope I can shorten the path.)\nI\u0026rsquo;m almost learning English while doing anything, I have an E-note with me which has the highest precedence for my E-notes. I note English quotes, words, and slang every day I encounter\u0026ndash;from a casual conversation, an official/random email, news media, watching a movie / TV show, or just purposefully reciting English words in the same sentence repo, and 2020 is the 4th year since I started doing it, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of myself.\nEmbrace digitalization I truly believe everything that can be digitalized will be digitalized, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of time and we\u0026rsquo;re just getting started, I\u0026rsquo;m so excited about standing on the edge of the curve, there is so much potential and opportunities ahead. And I\u0026rsquo;m also very grateful that I stumbled into this field accidentally, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been benefiting a lot, and I will try to get more and give back more if I can. üòÉ\nSunlight is the best disinfectant  Anything worth doing worthy doing publicly.\n I believe transparency is the solution for a lot of things I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, and as long as they\u0026rsquo;re transparent, we can hold them accountable, I\u0026rsquo;m more open to it.\nOpen source is taking over the software development.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not into bombshells. Burying yourself into a big, grandiose goal and hoping it someday and astonish the world, that\u0026rsquo;s not my style. Just like the agile philosophy in software programming, I\u0026rsquo;d like to just crank it out a prototype and try a quick iteration. The most important thing is that we\u0026rsquo;re in the right direction, we can adjust minor details along the journey.\nUse tools to make life easier Of course ideas and theories have large impact and longer influence, most of tools just like materialized objects from ideas. I know that, but I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to frequently learn new ideas, but I still want to make my life easier in an easy way. At the end of the day, knowing to use tool is one of the biggest differentiation keeping us from animals. I\u0026rsquo;d like to have all kinds of tools to facilitate my ways of thinking, reading and adapting new habits.\nOne of my favorite tool is Vim, I\u0026rsquo;ve used it for years, I\u0026rsquo;m still learning it on a daily basis, I almost use it all the time once in front of computer. I almost only editing/writing everything in the Vim environment. This kind of tool has implemented many philosophies and values, learning from a practical tangible tool about those ideas is just more fun. üòÉ\nScaling, Scaling, Scaling I\u0026rsquo;ve become old enough to not care much about many frivolous things and some nonsense traditions. Life is short, but it can be long enough if we focus, and I always wanted to learn things I could use it for decades, ideas I could apply to everywhere. My current life path is pretty linear, I\u0026rsquo;m waiting patiently and doing all the preparations I can imagine until one day my impact could take off üòº.\nBe happy and be nice Having a happy balanced lifestyle is crucial in the long run. I\u0026rsquo;m a naturally happy person, I\u0026rsquo;m living in life works for me. The key to my happiness is I always analysis, I heard that there is an old saying \u0026ldquo;suffering is the gap between current situation and expectations\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m total with it. Striving to improve my current status, recognizing, raising, or lowering my expectations, I adjust them in a relatively agile way by self-reflection on a daily basis.\nI\u0026rsquo;m genuinely happy when things make sense for me, even when they don\u0026rsquo;t side with me. Society has been generous to rational people like me, I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful about that, not everybody has the natural habit or pure luck that I do, I recognize it, to be nice to people I don\u0026rsquo;t really agree as a gratitude to the society is the way I\u0026rsquo;m practicing. üòá\n"

        "body": "I\u0026rsquo;ve always been fascinated by good tools, let me just record those tools have amazed me and I regret I didn\u0026rsquo;t try them earlier.\nFootrest \u0026amp; toning ball for my stiff neck I\u0026rsquo;ve been suffered from neck stiffness for years, I know it\u0026rsquo;s because my sedentary lifestyle and work style, I can\u0026rsquo;t change them in a short time. I did notice whenever I sit in front of my desk, my hands put on the surface of desk, the pressure either goes to my shoulder or I lay down more it goes to my lower back, no other way around. Until I found the footrest, it only takes $10+ bucks, I can vivid aware some of my upper body pressure goes to my foot which is awesome.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found stretching my body every once in a while during the day is a good habit to relax my body, specially for my wonky stiff neck. All of sudden I notice the toning ball in grocery outlet only cost $5 bucks, I started using it as an accompany during stretch since then. The ball is so comfort and versatile, I like it. üò∏\nTrue color for Terminal Vim I\u0026rsquo;ve always been bothered by the anemic UI support in terminal vim. It\u0026rsquo;s just so bland and primitive, before that I thought I don\u0026rsquo;t care about UI at all, it taught me I do care in a basic level. I turned to MacVim for years for the basic UI support. Now things will turn around, the terminal vim has better color and contrast then the MacVim, it might be a game changer, I might turn back to terminal vim and work with Tmux multiple windows and sessions for all my writing tasks.\nVim smoothie plugin This plugin is recommend from email subscription of \u0026ldquo;Mastering Vim quickly\u0026rdquo;, at beginning I was suspicious of this unpopular plugin which just has just 100+ stars in Github then. I gave it a try, it struck me for the first few minutes‚ùó.\nI never thought the scrolling in Vim should be smooth, but why not üòÑ? The user experience is so good, I can\u0026rsquo;t understand how I could I tolerate the bouncing jump, I can never go back.\nGoogle photos I went to Google photos just for the unlimited photo uploading for free (with some photo quality losing which is acceptable for me). As a person not that sensitive to privacy, I like Google a lot. I can lost or break my phone anytime, the most valuable assets are the photos/videos in my phone, it\u0026rsquo;s better have a cloud backup, automatically, painlessly. That\u0026rsquo;s a big mentally relief.\nThe feature abundance of Google photos really amazed me, I like it!\nTig \u0026amp; Git rebase interactive from Git I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved Git, I admire the stability, versatility and powerfulness from Git so much (Tho I started thinking Git does have bug as well, it struck me again since Git as an open source software we use all the time, but we almost assume it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have bugs).\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m kind of getting sick of the inconsecutive sequential commands in Git, the most notorious is the git stash, it\u0026rsquo;s just so inconvenient to check them up or clean them, lots of time we end up with tons of stash list we even can\u0026rsquo;t tell what are those shit inside, and we had to drop them all in batch which is awful practice. Another one like showing the content in the commit one by one is just drudgery work in terminal.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always loved those commands have the simplicity and easy to pipe ability in terminal, I thought I don\u0026rsquo;t care about UX much, Tig changed my idea, I do care. Tig provide the nice interactive terminal UI interface, I can make lots commands in consecutive, that\u0026rsquo;s awesome!\nAnother one is git rebase interactive, I\u0026rsquo;ve been amazed by how powerful and well-thought out about this subcommand. It might worth taking another post to illustrate, it gives me the ability and granular control of change history, like dancing in my repo, it\u0026rsquo;s so much fun.\n"
