<h3 id="hope-is-a-good-thing-maybe-the-best-thing-in-the-world-with-determination-">Hope is a good thing, maybe the best thing in the world (with determination )</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure others, as for me, I&rsquo;m really easy being touched by people made big success by long term continuse working, when I saw Andy open his arms in the raindrops embracing the baptism of new life after continuse dirty work in extremely condition, I was touched.</p>
<p>I have Mozart accompany me, you need something people can&rsquo;t take away</p>
<p>Hope is a dangerous thing, hope can drive people insane
I have vivid meomry of the book I read when I was a teen, &ldquo;Luo tuo xiang zi&rdquo;, he is nice, hardworking, motivated guy, the destroy of the hope of being together with that girl destroyed him, I always concern of having hope like that</p>
<p>Being focus on something and keep doing that for years always makes me fascinate</p>
<h3 id="i-have-mozart-acompaning-me">I have Mozart acompaning me</h3>
<p>I was so interested why he wanted to broadcast the music</p>
<h3 id="institutionalize">Institutionalize</h3>
<p>At beginning you hate it, then you get use to it, then you can&rsquo;t leave it, that&rsquo;s institutionation, I was shocked by this lines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be free, I try not to invest too deep on something which is not general and universal, I don&rsquo;t want to get trapped, but I also deeply feel getting commitment also makes me feel good. I was kind of dancing with between that</p>
<h3 id="i-love-being-inspired">I love being inspired</h3>
<p>I like being inspired, reading a life story of others always let me think about what if there is another path of my life, let me get some knowledge of life choice, life is about making choices, any of use can&rsquo;t experience everything, we can learn from others&rsquo; life story and make a best one for ourselves.</p>
<p>I love profanity words
God damn, I really love it. Those profanity words light me fighting will, those words are kind of like provoking, offenseing, anyone can be offsensed by any of those words and start a fight, and let&rsquo;s have a fight. It&rsquo;s like an art, you are alright to use some words in some situation but sometimes you got scewed for different people of different situation, it&rsquo;s like playing at the brink of dangerous, it&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m a really mild person, but I do enjoy this kind of risk, maybe I do like a fight as well.</p>
