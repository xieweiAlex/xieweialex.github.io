<p>I&rsquo;ve used hundreds of Apps in Mac and iPhone, some of them are good, some are bad, some are extraordinary great which give me fresh ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed by the slogan of Spark email client, &ldquo;Love your email again&rdquo;, Yeah, Spark has done a fantastic job, I used to hate email like most of others feel, email is still play an essential role of our information and communication tool, it used to be great and appreciated by everybody, but more and more input and abusing, it just gets overwelcomed very easily, it&rsquo;s so similar with our life, first we fall in love with something, we move all the possible focus and attentsion to it until it overwhelmed, then we don&rsquo;t see the beautity of it, then start hate it.</p>
<p>Spark solved some of the problems by using &ldquo;Mark as read&rdquo;, &ldquo;defer it later&rdquo;, pin, with nice shortcuts, make things organize better.</p>
<p>Another product I recent fell in love is &ldquo;Morning brew&rdquo;, they just send an email every morning keep me informed like a friend telling me a story. The difference is they tell story in a funny way, sarcastic, exaggerating or just make some funny analogy.</p>
<h2 id="passion-enthusiasm-with-love">Passion, enthusiasm with love</h2>
<p>Why I feel their love? Because they&rsquo;re focusing, they find a direction, a crack in life they can make it better, as consumers we don&rsquo;t have to use them, they have no right to enforce us. We use them because we like it, we feel the significant different. Let&rsquo;s say Facebook, we can&rsquo;t say Facebook is producing with Love, because it&rsquo;s so big, it&rsquo;s in dominant position in our modern social world, it&rsquo;s not a choice any more, it just got so much liability.</p>
<p>Make everybody happy is just impractical, the more you need to cover, the more liability and criticism you got, we can see from any democratic politician.</p>
<p>I like relative small product, they can focus, solve problem just like a small percentage of person like me. The more deep the focus, more they reach to my heart, that&rsquo;s kind of impossible, but if they can provide high enough customization, I will can&rsquo;t hold myself from digging into and customize for myself, eventually I will integrate myself fully with the tool, the tool became part of me, that&rsquo;s the end game.</p>
<p>Love is influencial, it can spread, influence</p>
<p>Love is subjective, so does happy,</p>
<p>Be happy, know what you&rsquo;re doing, spread the love</p>
