<p>There are some kind of girls I know I&rsquo;d love to get in touch if possible in the first sight, what are those characters attract me? Let me clean my thought by write it down.</p>
<h3 id="docile--diffidence">docile &amp; diffidence</h3>
<p>I first heard this two words phrase from the <a href="Youtube.com">Video</a>, that&rsquo;s the common stereotype of Japanese girls which lots of people like, yeah, shame to say, I&rsquo;m one of them. I think most probably I grew in a traditional confucian culture, it emphasis stabilization of family as the smallest unit of society is the essence of a good society, and female usually act as a assistant in the family which male adult is the leader. I&rsquo;m very used to it. I do admire the strong ego of modern women, but maybe just because my ego is relative weak, I just feel I&rsquo;m not able to work with that out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a traditional Asian adult who hopes I could be the cornerstone of the family(Yeah, in Asian culture, getting married and have children is a must, not an option), my partner would be better admire me, assist me.</p>
<p>Men usually acts as hard-edged character, but female act malleable other side. I really like girls have the malleable personality.</p>
<h3 id="sweet-smile--love-life">Sweet smile &amp; love life</h3>
<p>The same as majority male adult, I like girls have sweet smile and act sweet all the time if possible.</p>
<p>I like girls who can make life delicate and exquisite. I like those people who try to improve life quality all the time, understand the unspoken rules of life, get along with it that attracts me.</p>
<h3 id="empathy">Empathy</h3>
<p>I like girls who have strong empathy, she can understand the subtle feelings, she will be touched easily and comfort others when necessary.</p>
<p>After I wrote this down, I feel my expectations are typically old fashion Asian male way, which is a shame I always profess myself as a progress liberal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny I myself know myself in the bottom of my heart I naturally have those characters, in many years, I feel like my personality is like a girl, I&rsquo;d definitely willing the date a girl has a copy of my personality. But over the years striving in the society, I got over it, I changed quit a bit on the surface.</p>
<p>What are those characters put me off?</p>
<h3 id="aggressive">Aggressive</h3>
<p>Working or living with girls with aggressive personality really put me off, I had few experience, I got lost. But with male on the same situation, I don&rsquo;t that mind, I enjoyed challenge authority and being challenged by others as well, I know this sounds sexism, but it&rsquo;s just another old fashion Asian way.</p>
