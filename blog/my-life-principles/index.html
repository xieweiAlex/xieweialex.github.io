<p>As I&rsquo;m a lifetime learner turned 30 years old, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot. I&rsquo;ve found some life principles work for me very well and I&rsquo;d like to write them down to inspect and review them regularly.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-english">Embrace English</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasis the importance of English since I&rsquo;m living a country English is the official language, English ability would still one of my bottleneck for in few years. It takes time, I can&rsquo;t do it overnight or over a year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinate by the information abundance in English, besides that, all the tools and programming languages are in English, most of all, since I write everything in Vim and English in Vim is the best I can get for now. As I&rsquo;m looking to fit in or understand more about the Western culture, language plays a big part in culture (so does food, but I don&rsquo;t see myself would into it, I&rsquo;m so proud the tasty, delicacy and abundance of Asian food ðŸ™‚)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a hard time learning English during my youth and adult life, I&rsquo;ve spent tons of hours learning it on purposely in my adult time which I think it would be more fun and higher ROI in other things in a short term. I&rsquo;d like to have my kid growing up in a decent English speaking environment and it would be one of the biggest gift I leave for him/her.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-digitalization">Embrace digitalization</h3>
<p>Everything could be digitalized will be digitalized, and we&rsquo;re just getting started. Since I&rsquo;m working on the edge of the revolution, I&rsquo;m so excited every time it comes to my mind, I&rsquo;m very grateful I was accidentally get into the battlefield, and I&rsquo;ve been benefiting a lot, and I will try to get more. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<h3 id="sunlight-is-the-best-disinfectant">sunlight is the best disinfectant</h3>
<p>I heavily believe transparency is the solution for lots of things I don&rsquo;t understand, as long as they&rsquo;re transparent, we can hold them accountable, I&rsquo;m more open to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything worth doing worthy doing publicly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into bombshells. Like burying yourself into a big, grandiose goal and hope you can make it someday and stun the world, that&rsquo;s just not my style. Just like agile philosophy in software programming, I&rsquo;d like to gather feedback as soon as possible, and do retrospective regularly, fast iteration and loop.</p>
<h3 id="use-tools-to-make-our-life-better">Use tools to make our life better</h3>
<p>Lots of things are just tools make us better, either physically or digitally.</p>
<p>Tools change my mind how things can be done and should be done, it&rsquo;s infra.</p>
<h3 id="future-oriented">future oriented</h3>
<p>bottom of my heart, I don&rsquo;t have much sense of security, I got the comfortness and assurance by awaring it gonna work in a long term.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like sacrifice.</p>
<p>delay gratification</p>
<p>sustainable for a long term</p>
<h3 id="be-happy-and-be-nice">Be happy and be nice</h3>
<p>One of big part in western culture I like is it emphasis indivisiual personal happiness and achievement, I&rsquo;d like to always care for myself, ask myself what do I really want, what makes me happy and do things I think it&rsquo;s right, then I will be happy living consciously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy person I think most people around me can feel, I can be happy easily for little small things in life, that&rsquo;s just my nature. But as big things, in a big picture, how do I make myself happy?</p>
<p>Well, there are few things make me happy in general, political correct(I&rsquo;m a typical leftish), I feel cool about what I do, I feel myself strong both in mentally and physically, I earn more than I expend, I know what I&rsquo;m doing and it&rsquo;s sustainable, etc.</p>
<p>Current struggle is the planning missing days/years ago, prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>Life is imperfect, deal with it, some regret make your life more memorable(regardless the result might change, they might not true).</p>
