    <h3 id="adrian-is-my-role-model">Adrian is my role model</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked a handful of companies and numerous developers, Adrian is the dev who made the biggest impression on me, I&rsquo;m very grateful I had the chance working with him closely. I deeply believe that  I&rsquo;m a good developer, but he is great, as the future I can forsee I hope I can become as great as him.</p>
<h3 id="work-hard-and-get-reward">Work hard and get reward</h3>
<p>not only influencer, he is shaper
he reads super fast</p>
<p>He works super hard</p>
<p>He is avid TDD advocate, I had a hard time reading his code, that&rsquo;s so many layers of abstraction, but eventually I was totally bought about the idea of TDD and lots of ideas.</p>
<p>In a period of time, he literal brought a new idea or tools every morning about how to improve our process or tools he was amazed, I was wondering don&rsquo;t you every rest.</p>
<p>Work environment is like his playground, he is kind of having fun playing on it.</p>
<h3 id="have-fun-during-the-journey">Have fun during the journey</h3>
<p>He got so many quotes</p>
<ul>
<li>If I don&rsquo;t break anything, I don&rsquo;t learn anything</li>
<li>fail fast, fail early</li>
<li>I only do things I feel cool</li>
<li>Be the man make things happen</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="im-a-rude-person">I&rsquo;m a rude person</h3>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t accept my apology</p>
<p>I do everything</p>
<h3 id="superstar-shining">Superstar, shining</h3>
<p>He was promoted as mobile architect while I was on PTO in China during Sprint festival, I don&rsquo;t anybody would have any opposed idea about that. He was like a super star not only in the team, in the whole company I&rsquo;d say. He rebuild lots of project which he thought not working well, like the mobile release process(using CI to create release page, automatic tracking everything), Jira management, metric analyze etc, almost like every field he gets involved, he becomes an expert.</p>
<p>He talks a lot, I mean really a lot, I&rsquo;ve never seen a programmer as social as him, to be honest, he is really good at speaking, throwing jokes. But he also does lot of things, he gets himself into most of the projects(Hiring, interviewing, coding, QA, process management etc), but most of his coding time was at home after work hours, because there are so many people keep coming to here asking his advice, he was like a shining star, I can tell he was frustrating but also enjoying it. On a sharp contrary, I was siting right besides him, but nobody come to me.</p>
